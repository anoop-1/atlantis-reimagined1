  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Mumbai, India, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured against local realities: India's western corridor. Trombay/Mahul refineries. ONGC offshore Western Region. Reliance Hazira pipeline. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, OISD, DGMS mining are reflected in the workflow defaults.

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Mumbai inspection contractor serving BPCL Mahul refinery and HPCL Mumbai refinery deploys inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Mumbai EPC quality team standardizes inspection scheduling & interval management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ONGC Western Offshore portals automatically.",
    "A growing Mumbai-based service provider integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Reliance Hazira/Patalganga — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Mumbai inspection company uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass PESO and OISD audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inspection scheduling & interval management module configured for Mumbai operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, Indian Oil Mumbai. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, OISD, DGMS mining, DGFASLI requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Mumbai?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires engineering justification — corrosion-rate analysis, RBI re-assessment, or operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with full chain of approval and the new due date is automatically set. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 §3.3.1 maximum extension) are enforced."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer with code-aware scheduling logic. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
