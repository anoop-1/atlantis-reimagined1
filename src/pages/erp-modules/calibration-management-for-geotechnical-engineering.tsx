  "desc": "Calibration Management for Geotechnical Engineering Firms — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. ASTM D420 series (soil sampling), ASTM D2487 (USCS classification), ASTM D2216 (moisture). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every gauge, meter, probe, and instrument used to make a measurement-of-record must be calibrated against traceable standards on a defined interval. For a calibration laboratory under ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation this is the entire business.\n\nFor geotechnical engineering firms, the calibration management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: ASTM D420 series (soil sampling), ASTM D2487 (USCS classification), ASTM D2216 (moisture), ASTM D4318 (Atterberg limits), ASTM D2435 (consolidation). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Arup — engineering, Mott MacDonald — engineering, WSP — engineering, Atkins — engineering so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Per-asset calibration interval per ISO 17025 §6.4.7 with manufacturer-recommended overrides",
    "Reference-standard traceability chain: NIST / NPL / PTB / NIM / NMIA-traceable to your customer's instrument",
    "Uncertainty budget builder per JCGM 100:2008 (GUM) with Type A + Type B contributions",
    "ISO 17025 §7.8 compliant calibration certificate generation with measurement results table, environmental conditions, uncertainty, decision rule",
    "Customer asset register with separate ownership flag (in-house vs. customer-owned vs. loaner)",
    "Calibration order workflow: receipt → environmental conditioning → calibration → review → dispatch",
    "Tailored for geotechnical engineering firms — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Arup — engineering, Mott MacDonald — engineering, WSP — engineering vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person geotechnical engineering firm runs calibration management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational geotechnical engineering firms deploys calibration management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing geotechnical engineering firm integrates calibration management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven geotechnical engineering firms uses calibration management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does calibration management work specifically for geotechnical engineering firms?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for geotechnical engineering firms workflow with pre-built templates aligned to ASTM D420 series (soil sampling), ASTM D2487 (USCS classification), ASTM D2216 (moisture), ASTM D4318 (Atterberg limits). Operator-specific quality clauses for Arup — engineering, Mott MacDonald — engineering, WSP — engineering are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing geotechnical engineering firms tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major geotechnical engineering firms systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for calibration management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small geotechnical engineering firms to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person geotechnical engineering firm pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Is the platform ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited or audited?",
      "The platform is designed to be compliant with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 documentation requirements, but accreditation is granted to the laboratory, not the software. Atlantis NDT supports laboratories through ANAB, A2LA, UKAS, DAkkS, and NABL accreditation cycles with audit-ready document packages, change control records, and personnel competency files."
    ],
    [
      "Does it handle uncertainty budgets per the GUM (JCGM 100:2008)?",
      "Yes. The uncertainty builder supports Type A (statistical, from repeated measurements) and Type B (other, from calibration certificates and manufacturer specifications) contributions. Combined standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty (k=2 typical) are calculated automatically. Sensitivity coefficients can be entered for non-trivial measurement models."
