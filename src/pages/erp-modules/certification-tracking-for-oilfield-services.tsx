  "desc": "Certification & Personnel Qualification for Oilfield Services & Wellsite Inspection — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. API Spec 4F (drilling derricks), API Spec 6A (wellhead), API Spec 16A (drill-through equipment). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An NDT, welding, or inspection service company lives or dies by the currency of its technicians' certifications. A single expired ASNT Level II certificate on the wrong job can cost the contract, fail an audit, and damage the relationship with a major operator.\n\nFor oilfield services & wellsite inspection, the certification & personnel qualification module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: API Spec 4F (drilling derricks), API Spec 6A (wellhead), API Spec 16A (drill-through equipment), API Spec 16D (BOP control), API RP 53 (BOP). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil — upstream, Chevron — upstream, Shell — upstream, BP — upstream so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person oilfield services & wellsite inspection runs certification & personnel qualification as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational oilfield services & wellsite inspection deploys certification & personnel qualification across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing oilfield services & wellsite inspection integrates certification & personnel qualification with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven oilfield services & wellsite inspection uses certification & personnel qualification to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does certification & personnel qualification work specifically for oilfield services & wellsite inspection?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for oilfield services & wellsite inspection workflow with pre-built templates aligned to API Spec 4F (drilling derricks), API Spec 6A (wellhead), API Spec 16A (drill-through equipment), API Spec 16D (BOP control). Operator-specific quality clauses for ExxonMobil — upstream, Chevron — upstream, Shell — upstream are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing oilfield services & wellsite inspection tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major oilfield services & wellsite inspection systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for certification & personnel qualification while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small oilfield services & wellsite inspection to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person oilfield services & wellsite inspection pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Does it work with both SNT-TC-1A and ISO 9712 schemes simultaneously?",
      "Yes. Many inspection companies operate in markets requiring both — for example, a UAE company serving ADNOC (which accepts ASNT SNT-TC-1A) and operating in the EU (which requires ISO 9712). The system stores both qualification chains per technician with separate expiry, scope, and renewal workflows. Audit reports can be generated against either scheme or both."
    ],
    [
      "Can it match technician qualifications to job requirements automatically?",
      "Yes. When a project manager creates a job they specify required qualifications (e.g., 'UT Level II per SNT-TC-1A, valid BOSIET, ADNOC ACS-01 approved, English C1'). The system returns a ranked list of available technicians who match all criteria. Optional shadow-mode warns the project manager if any non-matching technicians are assigned."
