  "intro": "An NDT, welding, or inspection service company lives or dies by the currency of its technicians' certifications. A single expired ASNT Level II certificate on the wrong job can cost the contract, fail an audit, and damage the relationship with a major operator.\n\nFor metrology laboratories, the certification & personnel qualification module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: ISO/IEC 17025:2017, ISO 10012:2003 (measurement management), ANSI/NCSL Z540.1 / Z540.3, ILAC P14 (uncertainty), JCGM 100:2008 (GUM). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Mitutoyo (instrument OEM), Fluke Calibration (instrument OEM), Beamex (instrument OEM), Heise (pressure) so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person metrology laboratory runs certification & personnel qualification as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational metrology laboratories deploys certification & personnel qualification across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing metrology laboratory integrates certification & personnel qualification with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven metrology laboratories uses certification & personnel qualification to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does certification & personnel qualification work specifically for metrology laboratories?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for metrology laboratories workflow with pre-built templates aligned to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, ISO 10012:2003 (measurement management), ANSI/NCSL Z540.1 / Z540.3, ILAC P14 (uncertainty). Operator-specific quality clauses for Mitutoyo (instrument OEM), Fluke Calibration (instrument OEM), Beamex (instrument OEM) are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing metrology laboratories tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major metrology laboratories systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for certification & personnel qualification while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small metrology laboratories to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person metrology laboratory pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Does it work with both SNT-TC-1A and ISO 9712 schemes simultaneously?",
      "Yes. Many inspection companies operate in markets requiring both — for example, a UAE company serving ADNOC (which accepts ASNT SNT-TC-1A) and operating in the EU (which requires ISO 9712). The system stores both qualification chains per technician with separate expiry, scope, and renewal workflows. Audit reports can be generated against either scheme or both."
    ],
    [
      "Can it match technician qualifications to job requirements automatically?",
      "Yes. When a project manager creates a job they specify required qualifications (e.g., 'UT Level II per SNT-TC-1A, valid BOSIET, ADNOC ACS-01 approved, English C1'). The system returns a ranked list of available technicians who match all criteria. Optional shadow-mode warns the project manager if any non-matching technicians are assigned."
