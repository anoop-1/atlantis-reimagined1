  "desc": "Work Order & Job Management ERP module for inspection companies in Doha, Qatar. Pre-configured for QatarEnergy, RasGas and aligned with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company is a project-based business. Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Doha, Qatar, the work order & job management module is configured against local realities: QatarEnergy LNG capital. North Field expansion. Cryogenic LNG infrastructure. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), and regulatory frameworks under QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Doha inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Quote → Work Order → Project hierarchy with parent-child relationships",
    "Customer / contract / project / job / work order / line item — fully drilled-down billing structure",
    "Resource assignment: technicians, equipment, vehicles, sub-contractors, accommodation",
    "Per-line scope capture: method, asset, code, acceptance criteria, sample size, deliverable",
    "Field-app job execution: clock-in, GPS check-in, photo capture, data entry, supervisor sign-off",
    "Time, mileage, expense, per-diem capture with client billable / internal cost flags",
    "Tailored for Doha workflow — pre-configured operator templates for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG)",
    "Regulatory alignment with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Doha inspection contractor serving QatarEnergy and RasGas deploys work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Doha EPC quality team standardizes work order & job management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Qatar market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Doha-based service provider integrates work order & job management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Industries Qatar (IQ) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Doha inspection company uses work order & job management to pass QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Operator-portal flow-down from QatarEnergy updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ) require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the work order & job management module configured for Doha operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), QChem. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and other Qatar regulators?",
      "Yes. QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Doha?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Qatar: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
