  "desc": "Calibration Management ERP module for inspection companies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Pre-configured for Saudi Aramco (corporate HQ), SABIC HQ and aligned with HRSD labor, GAMI. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every gauge, meter, probe, and instrument used to make a measurement-of-record must be calibrated against traceable standards on a defined interval. For a calibration laboratory under ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation this is the entire business.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the calibration management module is configured against local realities: Saudi corporate capital. Aramco / SABIC / Ma'aden HQs. Vision 2030 megaproject PMOs. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Saudi Aramco (corporate HQ), SABIC HQ, Ma'aden (mining HQ), NEOM PMO, and regulatory frameworks under HRSD labor, GAMI, SASO standards are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Riyadh inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-asset calibration interval per ISO 17025 §6.4.7 with manufacturer-recommended overrides",
    "Reference-standard traceability chain: NIST / NPL / PTB / NIM / NMIA-traceable to your customer's instrument",
    "Uncertainty budget builder per JCGM 100:2008 (GUM) with Type A + Type B contributions",
    "ISO 17025 §7.8 compliant calibration certificate generation with measurement results table, environmental conditions, uncertainty, decision rule",
    "Customer asset register with separate ownership flag (in-house vs. customer-owned vs. loaner)",
    "Calibration order workflow: receipt → environmental conditioning → calibration → review → dispatch",
    "Tailored for Riyadh workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Saudi Aramco (corporate HQ), SABIC HQ, Ma'aden (mining HQ)",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Riyadh inspection contractor serving Saudi Aramco (corporate HQ) and SABIC HQ deploys calibration management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Riyadh EPC quality team standardizes calibration management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Saudi Arabia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Ma'aden (mining HQ) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Riyadh-based service provider integrates calibration management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by NEOM PMO — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Riyadh inspection company uses calibration management to pass HRSD labor and GAMI audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the calibration management module configured for Riyadh operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Saudi Aramco (corporate HQ), SABIC HQ, Ma'aden (mining HQ), NEOM PMO, Qiddiya / Red Sea Global. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with HRSD labor and other Saudi Arabia regulators?",
      "Yes. HRSD labor, GAMI, SASO standards, Aramco SAEP-1112 / 1142 requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Riyadh?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Saudi Arabia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

    ],
    [
      "Is the platform ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited or audited?",
      "The platform is designed to be compliant with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 documentation requirements, but accreditation is granted to the laboratory, not the software. Atlantis NDT supports laboratories through ANAB, A2LA, UKAS, DAkkS, and NABL accreditation cycles with audit-ready document packages, change control records, and personnel competency files."
    ],
    [
      "Does it handle uncertainty budgets per the GUM (JCGM 100:2008)?",
      "Yes. The uncertainty builder supports Type A (statistical, from repeated measurements) and Type B (other, from calibration certificates and manufacturer specifications) contributions. Combined standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty (k=2 typical) are calculated automatically. Sensitivity coefficients can be entered for non-trivial measurement models."
