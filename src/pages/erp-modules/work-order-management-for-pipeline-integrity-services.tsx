  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does work order & job management work specifically for pipeline integrity & ili services?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for pipeline integrity & ili services workflow with pre-built templates aligned to API 1163 (ILI qualification), API 1160 (pipeline IMP), ASME B31.4 / B31.8 / B31.8S (pipeline), API 1104 (welding). Operator-specific quality clauses for Enbridge — North American pipelines, TC Energy / TransCanada, Kinder Morgan — products are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing pipeline integrity & ili services tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major pipeline integrity & ili services systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for work order & job management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small pipeline integrity & ili services to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person pipeline integrity & ili service pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
