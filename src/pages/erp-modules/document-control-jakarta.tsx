  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Jakarta, Indonesia. Pre-configured for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia and aligned with SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Jakarta, Indonesia, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: Pertamina HQ. Indonesian state energy. LNG Bontang/Tangguh. Petrochemical Tuban/Cilegon. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, and regulatory frameworks under SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Jakarta inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Controlled-document register with unique ID, title, owner, classification, retention schedule",
    "Revision-controlled storage: every change creates a new revision with redline + author + reason",
    "Author / reviewer / approver workflow with e-signature per 21 CFR Part 11 (optional)",
    "Distribution list per document: who must read, who must train, who must acknowledge",
    "Training acknowledgment tracking with read-and-understood signature per revision",
    "Obsolete-document withdrawal with watermark + read-only flag (no silent deletion)",
    "Tailored for Jakarta workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG",
    "Regulatory alignment with SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Jakarta inspection contractor serving Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) and Pupuk Indonesia deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Jakarta EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Indonesia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Bontang LNG portals automatically.",
    "A growing Jakarta-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Tangguh LNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Jakarta inspection company uses document control & qms to pass SKK Migas and K3 Migas (HSE) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "cityPain": [
    "Document Control & QMS tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Jakarta operator-portal requirements",
    "SKK Migas audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Jakarta operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, Krakatau Steel. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with SKK Migas and other Indonesia regulators?",
      "Yes. SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board, BPOM (drug/food regulator for QC labs) requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Jakarta?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Indonesia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
