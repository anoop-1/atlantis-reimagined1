  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Houston, USA, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: Energy capital of the world. 4,600+ oil & gas firms. Continuous turnaround demand. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview, Valero Houston, and regulatory frameworks under OSHA Region 6 PSM, TCEQ air permits, USCG District 8 marine are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Houston inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Tailored for Houston workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Houston inspection contractor serving ExxonMobil Baytown refinery and Marathon Galveston Bay deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Houston EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the USA market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to LyondellBasell Channelview portals automatically.",
    "A growing Houston-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Valero Houston — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Houston inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass OSHA Region 6 PSM and TCEQ air permits audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Houston operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview, Valero Houston, Phillips 66 Sweeny. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with OSHA Region 6 PSM and other USA regulators?",
      "Yes. OSHA Region 6 PSM, TCEQ air permits, USCG District 8 marine, Texas Railroad Commission requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Houston?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for USA: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
