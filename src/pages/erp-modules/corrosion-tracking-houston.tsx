  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Houston, USA, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: Energy capital of the world. 4,600+ oil & gas firms. Continuous turnaround demand. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview, Valero Houston, and regulatory frameworks under OSHA Region 6 PSM, TCEQ air permits, USCG District 8 marine are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Houston inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML thickness history, with the short-term and long-term corrosion rates the inspector calculates stored alongside",
    "Wall-thickness trend per TML against the t-min and retirement thickness the inspector sets",
    "Damage mechanism records per API 571, as assigned by the integrity engineer",
    "Tailored for Houston workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Houston inspection contractor serving ExxonMobil Baytown refinery and Marathon Galveston Bay deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Houston EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the USA market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to LyondellBasell Channelview portals automatically.",
    "A growing Houston-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Valero Houston — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Houston inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass OSHA Region 6 PSM and TCEQ air permits audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Houston operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ExxonMobil Baytown refinery, Marathon Galveston Bay, LyondellBasell Channelview, Valero Houston, Phillips 66 Sweeny. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with OSHA Region 6 PSM and other USA regulators?",
      "Yes. OSHA Region 6 PSM, TCEQ air permits, USCG District 8 marine, Texas Railroad Commission requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Houston?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for USA: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "No. Atlantis ERP stores each UT thickness reading against its TML with the instrument, calibration record and technician, shows the thickness trend, and flags outlier readings for inspector review. The short-term and long-term corrosion rates under API 570 / API 653 are calculated by the inspector and can be recorded against the TML."
