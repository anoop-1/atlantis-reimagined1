  "desc": "Quality Management & NCR ERP module for inspection companies in Dubai, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC and aligned with ADQCC, MOIAT. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every accredited inspection company runs a quality management system. Whether it's ISO 9001, ISO 17025, AS9100, IATF 16949, or all of the above, the QMS needs to be functional — not just paper.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Dubai, UAE, the quality management & ncr module is configured against local realities: Regional HQ city for GCC oil & gas. EPC contractors, inspection service multinationals. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power, and regulatory frameworks under ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Dubai inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Nonconformance report (NCR) workflow: identification → containment → investigation → disposition → closure",
    "Root cause analysis tools: 5-Why, fishbone (Ishikawa), fault tree, FMEA",
    "CAPA lifecycle: corrective action → preventive action → effectiveness review",
    "Customer complaint intake and tracking with response-time SLA",
    "Supplier quality scorecard: on-time delivery, defect rate, audit performance, recall history",
    "Internal audit + external audit + accreditation audit integration (links to Audit Management module)",
    "Tailored for Dubai workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum",
    "Regulatory alignment with ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality — audit-ready evidence packages"
  ],
  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Dubai inspection contractor serving ADNOC Distribution and ENOC deploys quality management & ncr as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Dubai EPC quality team standardizes quality management & ncr across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to DUBAL aluminum portals automatically.",
    "A growing Dubai-based service provider integrates quality management & ncr with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by DEWA power — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Dubai inspection company uses quality management & ncr to pass ADQCC and MOIAT audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "ADQCC audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from ADNOC Distribution updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the quality management & ncr module configured for Dubai operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power, Dragon Oil. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADQCC and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality, DCAS requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Dubai?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UAE: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is the NCR → CAPA workflow structured?",
      "An NCR is opened on discovery (audit finding, customer complaint, internal observation, recurring issue). The workflow forces containment first (stop the bleeding), then investigation (root cause), then corrective action (fix this occurrence), then preventive action (stop it happening elsewhere). Effectiveness review 60–180 days later verifies the fix held. Each stage has a responsible owner, target date, and approval signature."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support AS9100D customer-specific quality clauses?",
      "Yes. AS9100D §4.4 requires that customer-specific quality clauses (e.g., Boeing D6-82479, Airbus PSPs, Pratt & Whitney ASQR-01) are flow-down to internal processes. The system maintains a customer-clause register with cross-reference to internal procedures, training records, and audit evidence."
