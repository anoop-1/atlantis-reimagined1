  "desc": "Audit & Compliance Management for Environmental Testing Laboratories — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. ISO/IEC 17025:2017, NELAP / TNI standard (US), US EPA methods (SW-846, 600 series, 500 series). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company faces audits from three directions: internal (your own QMS), external (client and regulator), and accreditation (ISO 17025, AS9100, ISO 9001). Failing any audit can mean lost contracts, suspended accreditations, regulatory penalties, and damaged reputation.\n\nFor environmental testing laboratories, the audit & compliance management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: ISO/IEC 17025:2017, NELAP / TNI standard (US), US EPA methods (SW-846, 600 series, 500 series), ASTM water / soil methods, EN ISO water-method series. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from SGS — global testing, Eurofins — environmental, ALS Limited — environmental, Bureau Veritas — environmental so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person environmental testing laboratory runs audit & compliance management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational environmental testing laboratories deploys audit & compliance management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing environmental testing laboratory integrates audit & compliance management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven environmental testing laboratories uses audit & compliance management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does audit & compliance management work specifically for environmental testing laboratories?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for environmental testing laboratories workflow with pre-built templates aligned to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, NELAP / TNI standard (US), US EPA methods (SW-846, 600 series, 500 series), ASTM water / soil methods. Operator-specific quality clauses for SGS — global testing, Eurofins — environmental, ALS Limited — environmental are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing environmental testing laboratories tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major environmental testing laboratories systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for audit & compliance management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small environmental testing laboratories to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person environmental testing laboratory pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support multi-standard audits — ISO 9001 + ISO 17025 + ISO 45001 — in one walk-through?",
      "Yes. Integrated management system (IMS) audits are supported: a single audit can map findings to multiple standard clauses simultaneously. The checklist library lets you compose an audit from clauses across standards. Findings are tagged with all applicable clauses for proper containment and reporting."
    ],
    [
      "How is corrective action effectiveness verified after closure?",
      "Each corrective action has a follow-up review scheduled 60–180 days after closure (configurable per finding type). The reviewer assesses whether the same issue has recurred, samples performance data, and signs off effectiveness. Failed effectiveness reviews automatically reopen the finding for further root cause analysis."
