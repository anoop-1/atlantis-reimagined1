  "desc": "Pre-configured for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea and aligned with HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Aberdeen, UK, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: UK offshore oil & gas capital. 50 years of North Sea ops. Offshore wind growth. Decommissioning hub. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS, TotalEnergies UK, and regulatory frameworks under HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Aberdeen inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",

    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Tailored for Aberdeen workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS",
    "Regulatory alignment with HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA) — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Aberdeen inspection contractor serving Harbour Energy and BP North Sea deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Aberdeen EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UK market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Shell UKCS portals automatically.",
    "A growing Aberdeen-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies UK — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Aberdeen inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass HSE OSDR and OEUK (Offshore Energies UK) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Corrosion Tracking tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Aberdeen operator-portal requirements",
    "HSE OSDR audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Aberdeen operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS, TotalEnergies UK, NEO Energy. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with HSE OSDR and other UK regulators?",
      "Yes. HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA), PSSR 2000 written scheme requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Aberdeen?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UK: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
