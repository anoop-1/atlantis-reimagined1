  "intro": "An inspection company faces audits from three directions: internal (your own QMS), external (client and regulator), and accreditation (ISO 17025, AS9100, ISO 9001). Failing any audit can mean lost contracts, suspended accreditations, regulatory penalties, and damaged reputation.\n\nFor pipeline integrity & ili services, the audit & compliance management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: API 1163 (ILI qualification), API 1160 (pipeline IMP), ASME B31.4 / B31.8 / B31.8S (pipeline), API 1104 (welding), DOT PHMSA 49 CFR 192 / 195. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Enbridge — North American pipelines, TC Energy / TransCanada, Kinder Morgan — products, Energy Transfer — gathering / transmission so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does audit & compliance management work specifically for pipeline integrity & ili services?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for pipeline integrity & ili services workflow with pre-built templates aligned to API 1163 (ILI qualification), API 1160 (pipeline IMP), ASME B31.4 / B31.8 / B31.8S (pipeline), API 1104 (welding). Operator-specific quality clauses for Enbridge — North American pipelines, TC Energy / TransCanada, Kinder Morgan — products are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing pipeline integrity & ili services tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major pipeline integrity & ili services systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for audit & compliance management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small pipeline integrity & ili services to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person pipeline integrity & ili service pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support multi-standard audits — ISO 9001 + ISO 17025 + ISO 45001 — in one walk-through?",
      "Yes. Integrated management system (IMS) audits are supported: a single audit can map findings to multiple standard clauses simultaneously. The checklist library lets you compose an audit from clauses across standards. Findings are tagged with all applicable clauses for proper containment and reporting."
    ],
    [
      "How is corrective action effectiveness verified after closure?",
      "Each corrective action has a follow-up review scheduled 60–180 days after closure (configurable per finding type). The reviewer assesses whether the same issue has recurred, samples performance data, and signs off effectiveness. Failed effectiveness reviews automatically reopen the finding for further root cause analysis."
