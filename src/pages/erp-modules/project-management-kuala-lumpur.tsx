Pre-configured for PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB and aligned with DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection on a major project is project management at industrial scale: 200 inspectors across 5 work fronts, 24-hour operation, holds at 12 critical inspection points, daily delivery of inspection reports to the EPC contractor, and a 90-day window before commissioning. Spreadsheets and email simply cannot manage this.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the project management & turnaround support module is configured against local realities: PETRONAS HQ city. ASEAN energy gateway. Petronas Technical Standards (PTS) compliance. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB, Petronas Chemicals (PCG), Sime Darby, and regulatory frameworks under DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), NIOSH Malaysia are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Kuala Lumpur inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

    "A Kuala Lumpur EPC quality team standardizes project management & turnaround support across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Malaysia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Petronas Chemicals (PCG) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Kuala Lumpur-based service provider integrates project management & turnaround support with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Sime Darby — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Kuala Lumpur inspection company uses project management & turnaround support to pass DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health) and Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the project management & turnaround support module configured for Kuala Lumpur operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB, Petronas Chemicals (PCG), Sime Darby, MISC. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health) and other Malaysia regulators?",
      "Yes. DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), NIOSH Malaysia, SIRIM QAS requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Kuala Lumpur?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Malaysia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle hold points and notification of customer / engineer?",
      "Hold points are defined per work order with hold type (W = witness, H = hold, R = review). When the work approaches a hold point the field app prompts the technician to issue a notification 24–48 hours in advance per the project's notification matrix. The customer / engineer confirms attendance; if waived, the witness/hold is automatically released with rationale logged."
    ],
    [
      "Can it integrate with Primavera P6 or Microsoft Project for schedule?",
      "Yes. The project schedule can be authored in Primavera P6 or MS Project and imported via XML / XER. Inspection activities are mapped to schedule activities; progress flows back from inspection completion data to the schedule. Bi-directional integration keeps the inspection plan and the project schedule aligned at all times."
