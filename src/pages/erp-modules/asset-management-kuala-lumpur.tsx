  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register ERP module for inspection companies in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Pre-configured for PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB and aligned with DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. The asset register is the spine that connects equipment, inspection history, drawings, P&IDs, isometrics, corrosion mechanisms, RBI assessments, fitness-for-service calculations, and integrity operating windows.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the asset integrity & equipment register module is configured against local realities: PETRONAS HQ city. ASEAN energy gateway. Petronas Technical Standards (PTS) compliance. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB, Petronas Chemicals (PCG), Sime Darby, and regulatory frameworks under DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), NIOSH Malaysia are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Kuala Lumpur inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

    "Equipment types: pressure vessel, piping circuit, storage tank, heat exchanger, fired heater, pump, compressor, exchanger tube bundle, valve, pipeline segment, structural member",
    "Damage mechanism library per API 571 (172 mechanisms): identification, screening, susceptibility scoring",
    "Integrity Operating Window (IOW) tracking with alarm levels (information / standard / critical)",
    "TML (thickness measurement location) database with sketch, photograph, GPS, and historical readings",
    "Corrosion rate computation (short / long term) per API 570 / API 653 methodology",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Kuala Lumpur inspection contractor serving PETRONAS upstream/downstream and PCSB deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Kuala Lumpur EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Malaysia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Petronas Chemicals (PCG) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Kuala Lumpur-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Sime Darby — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Kuala Lumpur inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health) and Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Kuala Lumpur operator-portal requirements",
    "DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health) audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from PETRONAS upstream/downstream updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for PCSB, Petronas Chemicals (PCG), Sime Darby require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Kuala Lumpur operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for PETRONAS upstream/downstream, PCSB, Petronas Chemicals (PCG), Sime Darby, MISC. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health) and other Malaysia regulators?",
      "Yes. DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety & Health), Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), NIOSH Malaysia, SIRIM QAS requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Kuala Lumpur?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Malaysia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

      "Yes. Bulk-import templates accept asset, equipment, functional location, and tag hierarchies from Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech APM, Bentley AssetWise, and Hexagon Meridium. Equipment numbering schemes, parent-child relationships, and equipment-class attribute sets are preserved. Ongoing sync via REST API keeps systems aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Does it cover API 571 damage mechanisms with screening?",
      "Yes. The damage mechanism module includes all 172 mechanisms from API 571 (3rd edition) with material, environment, temperature, and operating-condition screening criteria. The DM screening report identifies which mechanisms apply to each equipment item with severity ranking and recommended inspection methods."
