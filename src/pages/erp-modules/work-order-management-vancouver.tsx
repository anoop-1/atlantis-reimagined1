  "intro": "An inspection company is a project-based business. Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Vancouver, Canada, the work order & job management module is configured against local realities: BC Pacific gateway. TMX pipeline + Westridge terminal, Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada Kitimat upstream. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada (Shell-led JV), Coastal GasLink (TC Energy), and regulatory frameworks under Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER), Transport Canada are reflected in the workflow defaults.

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Vancouver inspection contractor serving Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline) and Parkland Burnaby refinery deploys work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Vancouver EPC quality team standardizes work order & job management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Canada market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to LNG Canada (Shell-led JV) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Vancouver-based service provider integrates work order & job management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Coastal GasLink (TC Energy) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Vancouver inspection company uses work order & job management to pass Technical Safety BC (TSBC) and BC Energy Regulator (BCER) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the work order & job management module configured for Vancouver operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada (Shell-led JV), Coastal GasLink (TC Energy), Seaspan Shipyards. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with Technical Safety BC (TSBC) and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER), Transport Canada, CER Canada Energy Regulator requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Vancouver?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
