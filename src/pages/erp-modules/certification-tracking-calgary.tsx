  "desc": "Certification & Personnel Qualification ERP module for inspection companies in Calgary, Canada. Pre-configured for Suncor, Cenovus and aligned with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An NDT, welding, or inspection service company lives or dies by the currency of its technicians' certifications. A single expired ASNT Level II certificate on the wrong job can cost the contract, fail an audit, and damage the relationship with a major operator.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Calgary, Canada, the certification & personnel qualification module is configured against local realities: Canadian oil & gas administrative center. Oil sands operations, pipeline midstream HQ. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, and regulatory frameworks under ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Calgary inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Calgary inspection contractor serving Suncor and Cenovus deploys certification & personnel qualification as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Calgary EPC quality team standardizes certification & personnel qualification across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Canada market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to CNRL portals automatically.",
    "A growing Calgary-based service provider integrates certification & personnel qualification with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Imperial Oil — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Calgary inspection company uses certification & personnel qualification to pass ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and AER (Alberta Energy Regulator) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the certification & personnel qualification module configured for Calgary operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, TC Energy. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator), CSA Group requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Calgary?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it work with both SNT-TC-1A and ISO 9712 schemes simultaneously?",
      "Yes. Many inspection companies operate in markets requiring both — for example, a UAE company serving ADNOC (which accepts ASNT SNT-TC-1A) and operating in the EU (which requires ISO 9712). The system stores both qualification chains per technician with separate expiry, scope, and renewal workflows. Audit reports can be generated against either scheme or both."
    ],
    [
      "Can it match technician qualifications to job requirements automatically?",
      "Yes. When a project manager creates a job they specify required qualifications (e.g., 'UT Level II per SNT-TC-1A, valid BOSIET, ADNOC ACS-01 approved, English C1'). The system returns a ranked list of available technicians who match all criteria. Optional shadow-mode warns the project manager if any non-matching technicians are assigned."
