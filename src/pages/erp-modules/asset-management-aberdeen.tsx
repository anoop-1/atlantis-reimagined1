  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register ERP module for inspection companies in Aberdeen, UK. Pre-configured for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea and aligned with HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. The asset register is the spine that connects equipment, inspection history, drawings, P&IDs, isometrics, corrosion mechanisms, RBI assessments, fitness-for-service calculations, and integrity operating windows.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Aberdeen, UK, the asset integrity & equipment register module is configured against local realities: UK offshore oil & gas capital. 50 years of North Sea ops. Offshore wind growth. Decommissioning hub. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS, TotalEnergies UK, and regulatory frameworks under HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Aberdeen inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Aberdeen inspection contractor serving Harbour Energy and BP North Sea deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Aberdeen EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UK market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Shell UKCS portals automatically.",
    "A growing Aberdeen-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies UK — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Aberdeen inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass HSE OSDR and OEUK (Offshore Energies UK) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Aberdeen operators?",
