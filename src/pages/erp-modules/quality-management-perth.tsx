  "desc": "Quality Management & NCR ERP module for inspection companies in Perth, Australia. Pre-configured for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) and aligned with WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every accredited inspection company runs a quality management system. Whether it's ISO 9001, ISO 17025, AS9100, IATF 16949, or all of the above, the QMS needs to be functional — not just paper.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Perth, Australia, the quality management & ncr module is configured against local realities: Western Australia LNG and iron ore gateway. Pilbara FIFO support. Carnarvon Basin offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, and regulatory frameworks under WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Perth inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Nonconformance report (NCR) workflow: identification → containment → investigation → disposition → closure",

    "CAPA lifecycle: corrective action → preventive action → effectiveness review",
    "Customer complaint intake and tracking with response-time SLA",
    "Supplier quality scorecard: on-time delivery, defect rate, audit performance, recall history",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Perth inspection contractor serving Woodside Energy and Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) deploys quality management & ncr as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Perth EPC quality team standardizes quality management & ncr across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Australia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to INPEX Ichthys portals automatically.",
    "A growing Perth-based service provider integrates quality management & ncr with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Santos GLNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Perth inspection company uses quality management & ncr to pass WorkSafe WA and NOPSEMA offshore audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Customer-format reports for Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the quality management & ncr module configured for Perth operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, BHP iron ore. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with WorkSafe WA and other Australia regulators?",
      "Yes. WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety, Australian Petroleum Safety Authority requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Perth?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Australia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is the NCR → CAPA workflow structured?",
      "An NCR is opened on discovery (audit finding, customer complaint, internal observation, recurring issue). The workflow forces containment first (stop the bleeding), then investigation (root cause), then corrective action (fix this occurrence), then preventive action (stop it happening elsewhere). Effectiveness review 60–180 days later verifies the fix held. Each stage has a responsible owner, target date, and approval signature."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support AS9100D customer-specific quality clauses?",
      "Yes. AS9100D §4.4 requires that customer-specific quality clauses (e.g., Boeing D6-82479, Airbus PSPs, Pratt & Whitney ASQR-01) are flow-down to internal processes. The system maintains a customer-clause register with cross-reference to internal procedures, training records, and audit evidence."
