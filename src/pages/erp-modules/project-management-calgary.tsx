  "desc": "Project Management & Turnaround Support ERP module for inspection companies in Calgary, Canada. Pre-configured for Suncor, Cenovus and aligned with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection on a major project is project management at industrial scale: 200 inspectors across 5 work fronts, 24-hour operation, holds at 12 critical inspection points, daily delivery of inspection reports to the EPC contractor, and a 90-day window before commissioning. Spreadsheets and email simply cannot manage this.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Calgary, Canada, the project management & turnaround support module is configured against local realities: Canadian oil & gas administrative center. Oil sands operations, pipeline midstream HQ. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, and regulatory frameworks under ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Calgary inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Project / sub-project hierarchy with parent project for major turnaround campaigns",

    "Resource leveling across simultaneous work fronts (UT crew, RT crew, PT crew, supervision)",
    "Shift scheduling for 24/7 operations with handover documentation",
    "Hold-point management: customer / regulatory / engineering hold definitions and notification workflow",
    "Daily progress report (DPR) with inspection counts, holds, photo summary, blockers, manpower",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Calgary inspection contractor serving Suncor and Cenovus deploys project management & turnaround support as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Calgary EPC quality team standardizes project management & turnaround support across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Canada market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to CNRL portals automatically.",
    "A growing Calgary-based service provider integrates project management & turnaround support with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Imperial Oil — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Calgary inspection company uses project management & turnaround support to pass ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and AER (Alberta Energy Regulator) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the project management & turnaround support module configured for Calgary operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, TC Energy. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator), CSA Group requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Calgary?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle hold points and notification of customer / engineer?",
      "Hold points are defined per work order with hold type (W = witness, H = hold, R = review). When the work approaches a hold point the field app prompts the technician to issue a notification 24–48 hours in advance per the project's notification matrix. The customer / engineer confirms attendance; if waived, the witness/hold is automatically released with rationale logged."
    ],
    [
      "Can it integrate with Primavera P6 or Microsoft Project for schedule?",
      "Yes. The project schedule can be authored in Primavera P6 or MS Project and imported via XML / XER. Inspection activities are mapped to schedule activities; progress flows back from inspection completion data to the schedule. Bi-directional integration keeps the inspection plan and the project schedule aligned at all times."
