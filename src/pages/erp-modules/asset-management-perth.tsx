  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register ERP module for inspection companies in Perth, Australia. Pre-configured for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) and aligned with WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. The asset register is the spine that connects equipment, inspection history, drawings, P&IDs, isometrics, corrosion mechanisms, RBI assessments, fitness-for-service calculations, and integrity operating windows.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Perth, Australia, the asset integrity & equipment register module is configured against local realities: Western Australia LNG and iron ore gateway. Pilbara FIFO support. Carnarvon Basin offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, and regulatory frameworks under WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Perth inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Perth inspection contractor serving Woodside Energy and Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Perth EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Australia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to INPEX Ichthys portals automatically.",
    "A growing Perth-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Santos GLNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Perth inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass WorkSafe WA and NOPSEMA offshore audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Perth operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, BHP iron ore. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with WorkSafe WA and other Australia regulators?",
      "Yes. WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety, Australian Petroleum Safety Authority requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Perth?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Australia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

Equipment numbering schemes, parent-child relationships, and equipment-class attribute sets are preserved. Ongoing sync via REST API keeps systems aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Does it cover API 571 damage mechanisms with screening?",
      "Yes. The damage mechanism module includes all 172 mechanisms from API 571 (3rd edition) with material, environment, temperature, and operating-condition screening criteria. The DM screening report identifies which mechanisms apply to each equipment item with severity ranking and recommended inspection methods."
