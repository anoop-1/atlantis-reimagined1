  "desc": "Corrosion Tracking & RBI ERP module for inspection companies in Dubai, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC and aligned with ADQCC, MOIAT. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to drive risk-based inspection (RBI) plans is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Dubai, UAE, the corrosion tracking & rbi module is configured against local realities: Regional HQ city for GCC oil & gas. EPC contractors, inspection service multinationals. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power, and regulatory frameworks under ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Dubai inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Risk-based inspection (RBI) per API 581: POF (damage factor) + COF (financial / safety / environmental)",
    "RBI risk-matrix dashboard (5x5 typical) with equipment ranking by risk score",
    "Inspection effectiveness scoring per API 581 Annex 2.C (highly effective / fairly effective / poorly effective)",
    "Tailored for Dubai workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum",
    "Regulatory alignment with ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality — audit-ready evidence packages"
  ],
  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Dubai inspection contractor serving ADNOC Distribution and ENOC deploys corrosion tracking & rbi as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Dubai EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking & rbi across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to DUBAL aluminum portals automatically.",
    "A growing Dubai-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking & rbi with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by DEWA power — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Dubai inspection company uses corrosion tracking & rbi to pass ADQCC and MOIAT audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Corrosion Tracking & RBI tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Dubai operator-portal requirements",
    "ADQCC audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from ADNOC Distribution updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking & rbi module configured for Dubai operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power, Dragon Oil. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADQCC and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality, DCAS requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Dubai?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UAE: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it implement the full API 581 RBI methodology?",
      "Yes. Both Part 2 (qualitative) and Part 3 (quantitative) workflows are supported. The damage-factor calculation engine implements all DMs in API 581 Annex 2 — thinning, SCC, HTHA, brittle fracture, external corrosion, mechanical fatigue, etc. The COF engine implements both financial-consequence (modified Part 5) and safety / environmental consequence models. Risk = POF × COF per Part 3 §5."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
