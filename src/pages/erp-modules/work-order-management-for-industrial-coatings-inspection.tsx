  "intro": "An inspection company is a project-based business. Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor industrial coatings inspection, the work order & job management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: NACE / AMPP CIP Level I / II / III, SSPC PA 2 (DFT measurement), SSPC SP 1 / SP 5 / SP 6 / SP 10 / SP 11 (surface prep), ISO 12944 (corrosion protection), ISO 8501 (visual cleanliness). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Hempel (paint mfr), Jotun (paint mfr), AkzoNobel International (paint mfr), PPG (paint mfr) so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person industrial coatings inspection runs work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational industrial coatings inspection deploys work order & job management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing industrial coatings inspection integrates work order & job management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven industrial coatings inspection uses work order & job management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does work order & job management work specifically for industrial coatings inspection?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for industrial coatings inspection workflow with pre-built templates aligned to NACE / AMPP CIP Level I / II / III, SSPC PA 2 (DFT measurement), SSPC SP 1 / SP 5 / SP 6 / SP 10 / SP 11 (surface prep), ISO 12944 (corrosion protection). Operator-specific quality clauses for Hempel (paint mfr), Jotun (paint mfr), AkzoNobel International (paint mfr) are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing industrial coatings inspection tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major industrial coatings inspection systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for work order & job management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small industrial coatings inspection to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person industrial coatings inspection pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
