  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Boeing — commercial / defense, Airbus — commercial / defense, Bombardier — business aviation, Embraer — regional jet so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Tailored for aerospace quality control — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Boeing — commercial / defense, Airbus — commercial / defense, Bombardier — business aviation vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person aerospace quality control runs asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational aerospace quality control deploys asset integrity & equipment register across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "An audit-driven aerospace quality control uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    [
      "Does asset integrity & equipment register work specifically for aerospace quality control?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for aerospace quality control workflow with pre-built templates aligned to AS9100D / AS9120 / AS9110 (MRO), NAS-410 Rev 5, FAA 14 CFR Part 145 / 21, EASA Part 145 / Part-M. Operator-specific quality clauses for Boeing — commercial / defense, Airbus — commercial / defense, Bombardier — business aviation are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."

    [
      "Can it scale from a small aerospace quality control to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person aerospace quality control pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
