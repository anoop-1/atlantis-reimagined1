  "desc": "Project Management & Turnaround Support ERP module for inspection companies in Mumbai, India. Pre-configured for BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery and aligned with PESO, OISD. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection on a major project is project management at industrial scale: 200 inspectors across 5 work fronts, 24-hour operation, holds at 12 critical inspection points, daily delivery of inspection reports to the EPC contractor, and a 90-day window before commissioning. Spreadsheets and email simply cannot manage this.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Mumbai, India, the project management & turnaround support module is configured against local realities: India's western corridor. Trombay/Mahul refineries. ONGC offshore Western Region. Reliance Hazira pipeline. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, OISD, DGMS mining are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Mumbai inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the project management & turnaround support module configured for Mumbai operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, Indian Oil Mumbai. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, OISD, DGMS mining, DGFASLI requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Mumbai?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle hold points and notification of customer / engineer?",
      "Hold points are defined per work order with hold type (W = witness, H = hold, R = review). When the work approaches a hold point the field app prompts the technician to issue a notification 24–48 hours in advance per the project's notification matrix. The customer / engineer confirms attendance; if waived, the witness/hold is automatically released with rationale logged."
    ],
    [
      "Can it integrate with Primavera P6 or Microsoft Project for schedule?",
      "Yes. The project schedule can be authored in Primavera P6 or MS Project and imported via XML / XER. Inspection activities are mapped to schedule activities; progress flows back from inspection completion data to the schedule. Bi-directional integration keeps the inspection plan and the project schedule aligned at all times."
