  "desc": "Audit & Compliance Management ERP module for inspection companies in Aberdeen, UK. Pre-configured for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea and aligned with HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company faces audits from three directions: internal (your own QMS), external (client and regulator), and accreditation (ISO 17025, AS9100, ISO 9001). Failing any audit can mean lost contracts, suspended accreditations, regulatory penalties, and damaged reputation.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Aberdeen, UK, the audit & compliance management module is configured against local realities: UK offshore oil & gas capital. 50 years of North Sea ops. Offshore wind growth. Decommissioning hub. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS, TotalEnergies UK, and regulatory frameworks under HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Aberdeen inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

      "Yes. Integrated management system (IMS) audits are supported: a single audit can map findings to multiple standard clauses simultaneously.

    [
      "How is corrective action effectiveness verified after closure?",
      "Each corrective action has a follow-up review scheduled 60–180 days after closure (configurable per finding type). The reviewer assesses whether the same issue has recurred, samples performance data, and signs off effectiveness. Failed effectiveness reviews automatically reopen the finding for further root cause analysis."
