  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor pipeline integrity & ili services, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: API 1163 (ILI qualification), API 1160 (pipeline IMP), ASME B31.4 / B31.8 / B31.8S (pipeline), API 1104 (welding), DOT PHMSA 49 CFR 192 / 195. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Enbridge — North American pipelines, TC Energy / TransCanada, Kinder Morgan — products, Energy Transfer — gathering / transmission so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person pipeline integrity & ili service runs inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational pipeline integrity & ili services deploys inspection scheduling & interval management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing pipeline integrity & ili service integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven pipeline integrity & ili services uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does inspection scheduling & interval management work specifically for pipeline integrity & ili services?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for pipeline integrity & ili services workflow with pre-built templates aligned to API 1163 (ILI qualification), API 1160 (pipeline IMP), ASME B31.4 / B31.8 / B31.8S (pipeline), API 1104 (welding). Operator-specific quality clauses for Enbridge — North American pipelines, TC Energy / TransCanada, Kinder Morgan — products are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing pipeline integrity & ili services tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major pipeline integrity & ili services systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for inspection scheduling & interval management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small pipeline integrity & ili services to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person pipeline integrity & ili service pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires engineering justification — corrosion-rate analysis, RBI re-assessment, or operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with full chain of approval and the new due date is automatically set. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 §3.3.1 maximum extension) are enforced."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer with code-aware scheduling logic. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
