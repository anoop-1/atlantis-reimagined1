  "intro": "An NDT, welding, or inspection service company lives or dies by the currency of its technicians' certifications. A single expired ASNT Level II certificate on the wrong job can cost the contract, fail an audit, and damage the relationship with a major operator.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Hyderabad, India, the certification & personnel qualification module is configured against local realities: South India industrial hub. BHEL heavy engineering. ISRO suppliers. Pharma + aerospace manufacturing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Hyderabad inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Hyderabad inspection contractor serving BHEL boilers/turbines and HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent) deploys certification & personnel qualification as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Hyderabad EPC quality team standardizes certification & personnel qualification across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ISRO satellite suppliers portals automatically.",
    "A growing Hyderabad-based service provider integrates certification & personnel qualification with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by BDL defense — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Hyderabad inspection company uses certification & personnel qualification to pass PESO and BARC nuclear audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the certification & personnel qualification module configured for Hyderabad operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, ECIL. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace, AERB radiation safety requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Hyderabad?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it work with both SNT-TC-1A and ISO 9712 schemes simultaneously?",
      "Yes. Many inspection companies operate in markets requiring both — for example, a UAE company serving ADNOC (which accepts ASNT SNT-TC-1A) and operating in the EU (which requires ISO 9712). The system stores both qualification chains per technician with separate expiry, scope, and renewal workflows. Audit reports can be generated against either scheme or both."
    ],
    [
      "Can it match technician qualifications to job requirements automatically?",
      "Yes. When a project manager creates a job they specify required qualifications (e.g., 'UT Level II per SNT-TC-1A, valid BOSIET, ADNOC ACS-01 approved, English C1'). The system returns a ranked list of available technicians who match all criteria. Optional shadow-mode warns the project manager if any non-matching technicians are assigned."
