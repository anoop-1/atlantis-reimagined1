Bruce, Darlington, Pickering CANDU stations.

    "A mid-size Toronto inspection contractor serving Bruce Power (8-unit CANDU) and Ontario Power Generation (Darlington, Pickering) deploys work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the work order & job management module configured for Toronto operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Bruce Power (8-unit CANDU), Ontario Power Generation (Darlington, Pickering), ArcelorMittal Dofasco (Hamilton), Stelco (Hamilton), Suncor Sarnia refinery. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with CNSC Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. CNSC Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, TSSA Ontario, CSA Group, ESA Ontario requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Toronto?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
