  "desc": "Inventory Management for Construction Quality Assurance — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. AWS D1.1 / D1.5 (welding), ACI 318 / 301 (concrete), ASTM D698 / D1557 (soil compaction). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection equipment is expensive, mobile, and tightly regulated. A UT thickness gauge, an Olympus OmniScan, a radiography crawler, or a digital pressure calibrator can each cost $10,000–$80,000.\n\nFor construction quality assurance, the inventory management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: AWS D1.1 / D1.5 (welding), ACI 318 / 301 (concrete), ASTM D698 / D1557 (soil compaction), ASTM C39 / C31 (concrete cylinder), ASTM E329 / E1155 (concrete floor flatness). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering, WSP — engineering so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Asset register with serial numbers, purchase dates, warranty, and depreciation schedule",
    "Barcode / QR code generation and label printing for fast physical tagging",
    "Mobile check-out / check-in with technician + job + project assignment",
    "Geofenced 'asset at site X' status with last-seen GPS coordinate",
    "Calibration certificate attachment per asset with auto-expiry alerts (90/60/30 day)",
    "Consumables tracking: couplant, penetrant, developer, radiography film, magnetic ink",
    "Tailored for construction quality assurance — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person construction quality assurance runs inventory management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational construction quality assurance deploys inventory management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing construction quality assurance integrates inventory management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven construction quality assurance uses inventory management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does inventory management work specifically for construction quality assurance?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for construction quality assurance workflow with pre-built templates aligned to AWS D1.1 / D1.5 (welding), ACI 318 / 301 (concrete), ASTM D698 / D1557 (soil compaction), ASTM C39 / C31 (concrete cylinder). Operator-specific quality clauses for Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing construction quality assurance tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major construction quality assurance systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for inventory management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small construction quality assurance to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person construction quality assurance pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system track NDT probe usage and life cycles?",
      "Each probe gets a barcode/QR tag. When a technician scans a probe on check-out the system logs technician, project, asset under test, and start time. On check-in it logs end time + auto-increments scan hours. PAUT wedges and PA probes have manufacturer-recommended life (typically 1,000–3,000 hours); when a probe approaches its limit the system flags it for inspection and the supervisor receives a dashboard alert."
    ],
    [
      "Can it manage radioactive sources for industrial radiography?",
      "Yes — the radioactive source module is built for IAEA TS-R-1 and US NRC 10 CFR 71 compliance. It tracks Ir-192 / Se-75 / Co-60 source serial numbers, current activity (auto-decayed from last measurement), expiry, shipment documentation, daily survey records, and technician dose exposure. Source-handling permits and route plans are stored against the asset with audit-ready PDF export."
