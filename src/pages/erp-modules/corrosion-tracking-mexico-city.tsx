  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Mexico City, Mexico, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: Pemex corporate HQ. CNH regulator. 6 Pemex refineries + Dos Bocas Olmeca new refinery. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Pemex (corporate + 6 refineries), Pemex Exploracion y Produccion, CFE electricity, Cemex (cement HQ), and regulatory frameworks under CNH Hydrocarbons Commission, ASEA (SASISOPA), STPS (NOM regulations) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Mexico City inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML thickness history, with the short-term and long-term corrosion rates the inspector calculates stored alongside",
    "Wall-thickness trend per TML against the t-min and retirement thickness the inspector sets",
    "Damage mechanism records per API 571, as assigned by the integrity engineer",
    "Tailored for Mexico City workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Pemex (corporate + 6 refineries), Pemex Exploracion y Produccion, CFE electricity",
    "Regulatory alignment with CNH Hydrocarbons Commission, ASEA (SASISOPA), STPS (NOM regulations) — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Mexico City inspection contractor serving Pemex (corporate + 6 refineries) and Pemex Exploracion y Produccion deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Mexico City EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Mexico market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to CFE electricity portals automatically.",
    "A growing Mexico City-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Cemex (cement HQ) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Mexico City inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass CNH Hydrocarbons Commission and ASEA (SASISOPA) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Customer-format reports for Pemex Exploracion y Produccion, CFE electricity, Cemex (cement HQ) require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Mexico City operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Pemex (corporate + 6 refineries), Pemex Exploracion y Produccion, CFE electricity, Cemex (cement HQ), Grupo BAL. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with CNH Hydrocarbons Commission and other Mexico regulators?",
      "Yes. CNH Hydrocarbons Commission, ASEA (SASISOPA), STPS (NOM regulations), CRE requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Mexico City?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Mexico: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "No. Atlantis ERP stores each UT thickness reading against its TML with the instrument, calibration record and technician, shows the thickness trend, and flags outlier readings for inspector review. The short-term and long-term corrosion rates under API 570 / API 653 are calculated by the inspector and can be recorded against the TML."
