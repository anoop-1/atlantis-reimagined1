  "intro": "An inspection company is a project-based business. Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor marine survey & offshore inspection, the work order & job management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: IMO MARPOL / SOLAS / STCW, IACS UR / common rules, DNV / ABS / LR / BV / ClassNK / RINA / KR class rules, IMCA D-018 IRM (offshore IRM), IMCA C-002 (diving inspection). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Shell — upstream / marine, BP — marine, TotalEnergies — FPSO operations, Equinor — Norwegian shelf so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person marine survey & offshore inspection runs work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational marine survey & offshore inspection deploys work order & job management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing marine survey & offshore inspection integrates work order & job management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven marine survey & offshore inspection uses work order & job management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does work order & job management work specifically for marine survey & offshore inspection?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for marine survey & offshore inspection workflow with pre-built templates aligned to IMO MARPOL / SOLAS / STCW, IACS UR / common rules, DNV / ABS / LR / BV / ClassNK / RINA / KR class rules, IMCA D-018 IRM (offshore IRM). Operator-specific quality clauses for Shell — upstream / marine, BP — marine, TotalEnergies — FPSO operations are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing marine survey & offshore inspection tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major marine survey & offshore inspection systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for work order & job management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small marine survey & offshore inspection to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person marine survey & offshore inspection pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
