  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Singapore, Singapore. Pre-configured for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom and aligned with MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Singapore, Singapore, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: Jurong Island petrochem hub. FPSO conversion (Keppel, Sembcorp). MOM CERT compliance. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, and regulatory frameworks under MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Singapore inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Controlled-document register with unique ID, title, owner, classification, retention schedule",

    "Author / reviewer / approver workflow with e-signature per 21 CFR Part 11 (optional)",
    "Distribution list per document: who must read, who must train, who must acknowledge",
    "Training acknowledgment tracking with read-and-understood signature per revision",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Singapore inspection contractor serving ExxonMobil Jurong refinery and Shell Bukom deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Singapore EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Singapore market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Vopak storage portals automatically.",
    "A growing Singapore-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Sembcorp Marine FPSO — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Singapore inspection company uses document control & qms to pass MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and NEA environment audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Singapore operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, Keppel FPSO yards. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and other Singapore regulators?",
      "Yes. MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine, EDB Singapore requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Singapore?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Singapore: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
