  "desc": "Inspection Scheduling & Interval Management ERP module for inspection companies in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG and aligned with ADNOC HSE, ADQCC. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Abu Dhabi, UAE, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured against local realities: ADNOC controls 94% of UAE reserves. Ruwais industrial complex. Sour gas processing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, and regulatory frameworks under ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Abu Dhabi inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Abu Dhabi inspection contractor serving ADNOC Onshore and ADNOC LNG deploys inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Abu Dhabi EPC quality team standardizes inspection scheduling & interval management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Borouge polyethylene portals automatically.",
    "A growing Abu Dhabi-based service provider integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Fertil ammonia/urea — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Abu Dhabi inspection company uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass ADNOC HSE and ADQCC audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inspection scheduling & interval management module configured for Abu Dhabi operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, TAQA power & water. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADNOC HSE and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA, EAD environment requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Abu Dhabi?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UAE: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires engineering justification — corrosion-rate analysis, RBI re-assessment, or operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with full chain of approval and the new due date is automatically set. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 §3.3.1 maximum extension) are enforced."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer with code-aware scheduling logic. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
