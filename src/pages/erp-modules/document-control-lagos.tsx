  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Lagos, Nigeria. Pre-configured for NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC and aligned with NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Lagos, Nigeria, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: Nigeria oil & gas hub. NNPCL refineries. Shell SPDC onshore. Deepwater offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, and regulatory frameworks under NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Lagos inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Controlled-document register with unique ID, title, owner, classification, retention schedule",
    "Revision-controlled storage: every change creates a new revision with redline + author + reason",
    "Author / reviewer / approver workflow with e-signature per 21 CFR Part 11 (optional)",
    "Distribution list per document: who must read, who must train, who must acknowledge",
    "Training acknowledgment tracking with read-and-understood signature per revision",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Lagos inspection contractor serving NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) and Shell SPDC deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Lagos EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Nigeria market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Chevron Nigeria portals automatically.",
    "A growing Lagos-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Lagos inspection company uses document control & qms to pass NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and NMDPRA (downstream) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Document Control & QMS tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Lagos operator-portal requirements",

    "Operator-portal flow-down from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Lagos operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, ExxonMobil Nigeria. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and other Nigeria regulators?",
      "Yes. NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS, NIMASA requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Lagos?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Nigeria: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
