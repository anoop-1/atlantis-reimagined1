  "desc": "Corrosion Tracking & RBI ERP module for inspection companies in Calgary, Canada. Pre-configured for Suncor, Cenovus and aligned with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to drive risk-based inspection (RBI) plans is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Calgary, Canada, the corrosion tracking & rbi module is configured against local realities: Canadian oil & gas administrative center. Oil sands operations, pipeline midstream HQ. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, and regulatory frameworks under ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Calgary inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Risk-based inspection (RBI) per API 581: POF (damage factor) + COF (financial / safety / environmental)",
    "RBI risk-matrix dashboard (5x5 typical) with equipment ranking by risk score",
    "Inspection effectiveness scoring per API 581 Annex 2.C (highly effective / fairly effective / poorly effective)",
    "Tailored for Calgary workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL",
    "Regulatory alignment with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator) — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Calgary inspection contractor serving Suncor and Cenovus deploys corrosion tracking & rbi as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Calgary EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking & rbi across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Canada market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to CNRL portals automatically.",
    "A growing Calgary-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking & rbi with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Imperial Oil — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Calgary inspection company uses corrosion tracking & rbi to pass ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and AER (Alberta Energy Regulator) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Corrosion Tracking & RBI tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Calgary operator-portal requirements",
    "ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from Suncor updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking & rbi module configured for Calgary operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Suncor, Cenovus, CNRL, Imperial Oil, TC Energy. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety) and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. ABSA (Alberta Boilers Safety), AER (Alberta Energy Regulator), CER (Canada Energy Regulator), CSA Group requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Calgary?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it implement the full API 581 RBI methodology?",
      "Yes. Both Part 2 (qualitative) and Part 3 (quantitative) workflows are supported. The damage-factor calculation engine implements all DMs in API 581 Annex 2 — thinning, SCC, HTHA, brittle fracture, external corrosion, mechanical fatigue, etc. The COF engine implements both financial-consequence (modified Part 5) and safety / environmental consequence models. Risk = POF × COF per Part 3 §5."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
