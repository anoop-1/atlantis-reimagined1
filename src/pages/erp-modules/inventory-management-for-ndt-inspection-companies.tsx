  "intro": "Inspection equipment is expensive, mobile, and tightly regulated. A UT thickness gauge, an Olympus OmniScan, a radiography crawler, or a digital pressure calibrator can each cost $10,000–$80,000.\n\nFor ndt inspection companies, the inventory management module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: ASNT SNT-TC-1A / CP-189 / ACCP, ISO 9712:2021, PCN GEN, CSWIP 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3, AWS QC1. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Saudi Aramco — SAEP-1142, ADNOC — ACS-01, QatarEnergy — NFPS, Shell — DEP so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person ndt inspection company runs inventory management as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational ndt inspection companies deploys inventory management across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing ndt inspection company integrates inventory management with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven ndt inspection companies uses inventory management to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does inventory management work specifically for ndt inspection companies?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for ndt inspection companies workflow with pre-built templates aligned to ASNT SNT-TC-1A / CP-189 / ACCP, ISO 9712:2021, PCN GEN, CSWIP 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3. Operator-specific quality clauses for Saudi Aramco — SAEP-1142, ADNOC — ACS-01, QatarEnergy — NFPS are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing ndt inspection companies tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major ndt inspection companies systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for inventory management while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small ndt inspection companies to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person ndt inspection company pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system track NDT probe usage and life cycles?",
      "Each probe gets a barcode/QR tag. When a technician scans a probe on check-out the system logs technician, project, asset under test, and start time. On check-in it logs end time + auto-increments scan hours. PAUT wedges and PA probes have manufacturer-recommended life (typically 1,000–3,000 hours); when a probe approaches its limit the system flags it for inspection and the supervisor receives a dashboard alert."
    ],
    [
      "Can it manage radioactive sources for industrial radiography?",
      "Yes — the radioactive source module is built for IAEA TS-R-1 and US NRC 10 CFR 71 compliance. It tracks Ir-192 / Se-75 / Co-60 source serial numbers, current activity (auto-decayed from last measurement), expiry, shipment documentation, daily survey records, and technician dose exposure. Source-handling permits and route plans are stored against the asset with audit-ready PDF export."
