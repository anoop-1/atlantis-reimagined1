  "desc": "Calibration Management ERP module for inspection companies in Vancouver, Canada. Pre-configured for Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery and aligned with Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every gauge, meter, probe, and instrument used to make a measurement-of-record must be calibrated against traceable standards on a defined interval. For a calibration laboratory under ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation this is the entire business.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Vancouver, Canada, the calibration management module is configured against local realities: BC Pacific gateway. TMX pipeline + Westridge terminal, Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada Kitimat upstream. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada (Shell-led JV), Coastal GasLink (TC Energy), and regulatory frameworks under Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER), Transport Canada are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Vancouver inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-asset calibration interval per ISO 17025 §6.4.7 with manufacturer-recommended overrides",
    "Reference-standard traceability chain: NIST / NPL / PTB / NIM / NMIA-traceable to your customer's instrument",
    "Uncertainty budget builder per JCGM 100:2008 (GUM) with Type A + Type B contributions",
    "ISO 17025 §7.8 compliant calibration certificate generation with measurement results table, environmental conditions, uncertainty, decision rule",
    "Customer asset register with separate ownership flag (in-house vs. customer-owned vs. loaner)",
    "Calibration order workflow: receipt → environmental conditioning → calibration → review → dispatch",
    "Tailored for Vancouver workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada (Shell-led JV)",
    "Regulatory alignment with Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER), Transport Canada — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Vancouver inspection contractor serving Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline) and Parkland Burnaby refinery deploys calibration management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Vancouver EPC quality team standardizes calibration management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Canada market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to LNG Canada (Shell-led JV) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Vancouver-based service provider integrates calibration management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Coastal GasLink (TC Energy) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Vancouver inspection company uses calibration management to pass Technical Safety BC (TSBC) and BC Energy Regulator (BCER) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the calibration management module configured for Vancouver operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Trans Mountain (TMX pipeline), Parkland Burnaby refinery, LNG Canada (Shell-led JV), Coastal GasLink (TC Energy), Seaspan Shipyards. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with Technical Safety BC (TSBC) and other Canada regulators?",
      "Yes. Technical Safety BC (TSBC), BC Energy Regulator (BCER), Transport Canada, CER Canada Energy Regulator requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Vancouver?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Canada: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Is the platform ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited or audited?",
      "The platform is designed to be compliant with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 documentation requirements, but accreditation is granted to the laboratory, not the software. Atlantis NDT supports laboratories through ANAB, A2LA, UKAS, DAkkS, and NABL accreditation cycles with audit-ready document packages, change control records, and personnel competency files."
    ],
    [
      "Does it handle uncertainty budgets per the GUM (JCGM 100:2008)?",
      "Yes. The uncertainty builder supports Type A (statistical, from repeated measurements) and Type B (other, from calibration certificates and manufacturer specifications) contributions. Combined standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty (k=2 typical) are calculated automatically. Sensitivity coefficients can be entered for non-trivial measurement models."
