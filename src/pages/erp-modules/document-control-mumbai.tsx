  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Mumbai, India. Pre-configured for BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery and aligned with PESO, OISD. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Mumbai, India, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: India's western corridor. Trombay/Mahul refineries. ONGC offshore Western Region. Reliance Hazira pipeline. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, OISD, DGMS mining are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Mumbai inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Mumbai inspection contractor serving BPCL Mahul refinery and HPCL Mumbai refinery deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Mumbai EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ONGC Western Offshore portals automatically.",
    "A growing Mumbai-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Reliance Hazira/Patalganga — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Mumbai inspection company uses document control & qms to pass PESO and OISD audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Mumbai operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BPCL Mahul refinery, HPCL Mumbai refinery, ONGC Western Offshore, Reliance Hazira/Patalganga, Indian Oil Mumbai. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, OISD, DGMS mining, DGFASLI requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Mumbai?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
