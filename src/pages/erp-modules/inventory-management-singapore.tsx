  "desc": "Inventory Management ERP module for inspection companies in Singapore, Singapore. Pre-configured for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom and aligned with MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection equipment is expensive, mobile, and tightly regulated. A UT thickness gauge, an Olympus OmniScan, a radiography crawler, or a digital pressure calibrator can each cost $10,000–$80,000.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Singapore, Singapore, the inventory management module is configured against local realities: Jurong Island petrochem hub. FPSO conversion (Keppel, Sembcorp). MOM CERT compliance. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, and regulatory frameworks under MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Singapore inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Singapore inspection contractor serving ExxonMobil Jurong refinery and Shell Bukom deploys inventory management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Singapore EPC quality team standardizes inventory management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Singapore market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Vopak storage portals automatically.",
    "A growing Singapore-based service provider integrates inventory management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Sembcorp Marine FPSO — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Singapore inspection company uses inventory management to pass MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and NEA environment audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inventory management module configured for Singapore operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, Keppel FPSO yards. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and other Singapore regulators?",
      "Yes. MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine, EDB Singapore requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Singapore?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Singapore: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system track NDT probe usage and life cycles?",
      "Each probe gets a barcode/QR tag. When a technician scans a probe on check-out the system logs technician, project, asset under test, and start time. On check-in it logs end time + auto-increments scan hours. PAUT wedges and PA probes have manufacturer-recommended life (typically 1,000–3,000 hours); when a probe approaches its limit the system flags it for inspection and the supervisor receives a dashboard alert."
    ],
    [
      "Can it manage radioactive sources for industrial radiography?",
      "Yes — the radioactive source module is built for IAEA TS-R-1 and US NRC 10 CFR 71 compliance. It tracks Ir-192 / Se-75 / Co-60 source serial numbers, current activity (auto-decayed from last measurement), expiry, shipment documentation, daily survey records, and technician dose exposure. Source-handling permits and route plans are stored against the asset with audit-ready PDF export."
