  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Doha, Qatar, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: QatarEnergy LNG capital. North Field expansion. Cryogenic LNG infrastructure. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), and regulatory frameworks under QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Doha inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML thickness history, with the short-term and long-term corrosion rates the inspector calculates stored alongside",
    "Wall-thickness trend per TML against the t-min and retirement thickness the inspector sets",
    "Damage mechanism records per API 571, as assigned by the integrity engineer",
    "Tailored for Doha workflow — pre-configured operator templates for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG)",
    "Regulatory alignment with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Doha inspection contractor serving QatarEnergy and RasGas deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Doha EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Qatar market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Doha-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Industries Qatar (IQ) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Doha inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Operator-portal flow-down from QatarEnergy updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ) require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Doha operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), QChem. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and other Qatar regulators?",
      "Yes. QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Doha?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Qatar: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "No. Atlantis ERP stores each UT thickness reading against its TML with the instrument, calibration record and technician, shows the thickness trend, and flags outlier readings for inspector review. The short-term and long-term corrosion rates under API 570 / API 653 are calculated by the inspector and can be recorded against the TML."
