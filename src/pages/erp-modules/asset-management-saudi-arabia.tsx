  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. SAEP-1112 / SAEP-1142. Vision 2030 mega-projects. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Saudi Aramco upstream/downstream, SABIC petrochemicals, Ma'aden mining, SADAF, and regulatory frameworks under HRSD, GAMI, SASO are reflected in the workflow defaults.

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Saudi Arabia inspection contractor serving Saudi Aramco upstream/downstream and SABIC petrochemicals deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Saudi Arabia EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Saudi Arabia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Ma'aden mining portals automatically.",
    "A growing Saudi Arabia-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by SADAF — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Saudi Arabia inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass HRSD and GAMI audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Saudi Arabia operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Saudi Aramco upstream/downstream, SABIC petrochemicals, Ma'aden mining, SADAF, KEMYA. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."

    [
      "Does it comply with HRSD and other Saudi Arabia regulators?",
      "Yes. HRSD, GAMI, SASO, Aramco SAEP requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
