  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Aberdeen, UK. Pre-configured for Harbour Energy, BP North Sea and aligned with HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Aberdeen, UK, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: UK offshore oil & gas capital. 50 years of North Sea ops. Offshore wind growth. Decommissioning hub. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Harbour Energy, BP North Sea, Shell UKCS, TotalEnergies UK, and regulatory frameworks under HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA) are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Aberdeen inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Aberdeen inspection contractor serving Harbour Energy and BP North Sea deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Aberdeen EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UK market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Shell UKCS portals automatically.",
    "A growing Aberdeen-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies UK — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Aberdeen operators?",

Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with HSE OSDR and other UK regulators?",
      "Yes. HSE OSDR, OEUK (Offshore Energies UK), NSTA (former OGA), PSSR 2000 written scheme requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Aberdeen?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UK: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
