Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Hyderabad, India, the work order & job management module is configured against local realities: South India industrial hub. BHEL heavy engineering. ISRO suppliers. Pharma + aerospace manufacturing.

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Hyderabad inspection contractor serving BHEL boilers/turbines and HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent) deploys work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Hyderabad EPC quality team standardizes work order & job management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ISRO satellite suppliers portals automatically.",
    "A growing Hyderabad-based service provider integrates work order & job management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by BDL defense — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Hyderabad inspection company uses work order & job management to pass PESO and BARC nuclear audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Customer-format reports for HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the work order & job management module configured for Hyderabad operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, ECIL. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace, AERB radiation safety requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Hyderabad?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
