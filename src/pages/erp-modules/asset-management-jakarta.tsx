  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register ERP module for inspection companies in Jakarta, Indonesia. Pre-configured for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia and aligned with SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. The asset register is the spine that connects equipment, inspection history, drawings, P&IDs, isometrics, corrosion mechanisms, RBI assessments, fitness-for-service calculations, and integrity operating windows.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Jakarta, Indonesia, the asset integrity & equipment register module is configured against local realities: Pertamina HQ. Indonesian state energy. LNG Bontang/Tangguh. Petrochemical Tuban/Cilegon. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, and regulatory frameworks under SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Jakarta inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Hierarchical asset structure: site → unit → system → equipment → component → TML",
    "Equipment types: pressure vessel, piping circuit, storage tank, heat exchanger, fired heater, pump, compressor, exchanger tube bundle, valve, pipeline segment, structural member",
    "Damage mechanism library per API 571 (172 mechanisms): identification, screening, susceptibility scoring",
    "Integrity Operating Window (IOW) tracking with alarm levels (information / standard / critical)",
    "TML (thickness measurement location) database with sketch, photograph, GPS, and historical readings",
    "Corrosion rate computation (short / long term) per API 570 / API 653 methodology",
    "Tailored for Jakarta workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG",
    "Regulatory alignment with SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Jakarta inspection contractor serving Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) and Pupuk Indonesia deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Jakarta EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Indonesia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Bontang LNG portals automatically.",
    "A growing Jakarta-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Tangguh LNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Jakarta inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass SKK Migas and K3 Migas (HSE) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "cityPain": [
    "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Jakarta operator-portal requirements",
    "SKK Migas audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Jakarta operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, Krakatau Steel. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with SKK Migas and other Indonesia regulators?",
      "Yes. SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board, BPOM (drug/food regulator for QC labs) requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Jakarta?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Indonesia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can it import asset hierarchies from existing CMMS / APM systems?",
      "Yes. Bulk-import templates accept asset, equipment, functional location, and tag hierarchies from Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech APM, Bentley AssetWise, and Hexagon Meridium. Equipment numbering schemes, parent-child relationships, and equipment-class attribute sets are preserved. Ongoing sync via REST API keeps systems aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Does it cover API 571 damage mechanisms with screening?",
      "Yes. The damage mechanism module includes all 172 mechanisms from API 571 (3rd edition) with material, environment, temperature, and operating-condition screening criteria. The DM screening report identifies which mechanisms apply to each equipment item with severity ranking and recommended inspection methods."
