  "desc": "Quality Management & NCR for Marine Survey & Offshore Inspection — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. IMO MARPOL / SOLAS / STCW, IACS UR / common rules, DNV / ABS / LR / BV / ClassNK / RINA / KR class rules. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every accredited inspection company runs a quality management system. Whether it's ISO 9001, ISO 17025, AS9100, IATF 16949, or all of the above, the QMS needs to be functional — not just paper.\n\nFor marine survey & offshore inspection, the quality management & ncr module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: IMO MARPOL / SOLAS / STCW, IACS UR / common rules, DNV / ABS / LR / BV / ClassNK / RINA / KR class rules, IMCA D-018 IRM (offshore IRM), IMCA C-002 (diving inspection). Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Shell — upstream / marine, BP — marine, TotalEnergies — FPSO operations, Equinor — Norwegian shelf so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Nonconformance report (NCR) workflow: identification → containment → investigation → disposition → closure",
    "Root cause analysis tools: 5-Why, fishbone (Ishikawa), fault tree, FMEA",
    "CAPA lifecycle: corrective action → preventive action → effectiveness review",
    "Customer complaint intake and tracking with response-time SLA",
    "Supplier quality scorecard: on-time delivery, defect rate, audit performance, recall history",
    "Internal audit + external audit + accreditation audit integration (links to Audit Management module)",
    "Tailored for marine survey & offshore inspection — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Shell — upstream / marine, BP — marine, TotalEnergies — FPSO operations vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person marine survey & offshore inspection runs quality management & ncr as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational marine survey & offshore inspection deploys quality management & ncr across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing marine survey & offshore inspection integrates quality management & ncr with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven marine survey & offshore inspection uses quality management & ncr to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does quality management & ncr work specifically for marine survey & offshore inspection?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for marine survey & offshore inspection workflow with pre-built templates aligned to IMO MARPOL / SOLAS / STCW, IACS UR / common rules, DNV / ABS / LR / BV / ClassNK / RINA / KR class rules, IMCA D-018 IRM (offshore IRM). Operator-specific quality clauses for Shell — upstream / marine, BP — marine, TotalEnergies — FPSO operations are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing marine survey & offshore inspection tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major marine survey & offshore inspection systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for quality management & ncr while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small marine survey & offshore inspection to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person marine survey & offshore inspection pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "How is the NCR → CAPA workflow structured?",
      "An NCR is opened on discovery (audit finding, customer complaint, internal observation, recurring issue). The workflow forces containment first (stop the bleeding), then investigation (root cause), then corrective action (fix this occurrence), then preventive action (stop it happening elsewhere). Effectiveness review 60–180 days later verifies the fix held. Each stage has a responsible owner, target date, and approval signature."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support AS9100D customer-specific quality clauses?",
      "Yes. AS9100D §4.4 requires that customer-specific quality clauses (e.g., Boeing D6-82479, Airbus PSPs, Pratt & Whitney ASQR-01) are flow-down to internal processes. The system maintains a customer-clause register with cross-reference to internal procedures, training records, and audit evidence."
