Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

      "Does it support multi-standard audits — ISO 9001 + ISO 17025 + ISO 45001 — in one walk-through?",
      "Yes. Integrated management system (IMS) audits are supported: a single audit can map findings to multiple standard clauses simultaneously. The checklist library lets you compose an audit from clauses across standards. Findings are tagged with all applicable clauses for proper containment and reporting."
    ],
    [
      "How is corrective action effectiveness verified after closure?",
      "Each corrective action has a follow-up review scheduled 60–180 days after closure (configurable per finding type). The reviewer assesses whether the same issue has recurred, samples performance data, and signs off effectiveness. Failed effectiveness reviews automatically reopen the finding for further root cause analysis."
