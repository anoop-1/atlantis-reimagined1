  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Hyderabad, India, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured against local realities: South India industrial hub. BHEL heavy engineering. ISRO suppliers. Pharma + aerospace manufacturing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Hyderabad inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "API 510 pressure vessel due dates (external, internal, on-stream) entered by the inspector, with reminders before each falls due",
    "API 570 piping due dates by circuit and class, entered by the inspector, with reminders before each falls due",
    "API 653 tank due dates (routine, external, internal) entered by the inspector, with reminders before each falls due",
    "ASME B31.3 process piping due dates, including the severe cyclic service items the inspector flags",
    "Inspection due forecast: 30 / 60 / 90 / 180 / 365 day windows with criticality ranking",
    "Tailored for Hyderabad workflow — pre-configured operator templates for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Hyderabad inspection contractor serving BHEL boilers/turbines and HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent) deploys inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Hyderabad EPC quality team standardizes inspection scheduling & interval management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ISRO satellite suppliers portals automatically.",
    "A growing Hyderabad-based service provider integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by BDL defense — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Hyderabad inspection company uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass PESO and BARC nuclear audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inspection scheduling & interval management module configured for Hyderabad operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, ECIL. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace, AERB radiation safety requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Hyderabad?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires an engineering justification — a corrosion-rate or remaining-life re-assessment by the inspector, or an operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with the full chain of approval, and the new due date the inspector sets is recorded with reminders. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 maximum extensions) are shown to the approvers to check."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer holding due dates, readings and records. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
