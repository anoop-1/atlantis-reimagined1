  "desc": "Quality Management & NCR ERP module for inspection companies in Hyderabad, India. Pre-configured for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent) and aligned with PESO, BARC nuclear. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Every accredited inspection company runs a quality management system. Whether it's ISO 9001, ISO 17025, AS9100, IATF 16949, or all of the above, the QMS needs to be functional — not just paper.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Hyderabad, India, the quality management & ncr module is configured against local realities: South India industrial hub. BHEL heavy engineering. ISRO suppliers. Pharma + aerospace manufacturing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, and regulatory frameworks under PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Hyderabad inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Nonconformance report (NCR) workflow: identification → containment → investigation → disposition → closure",
    "Root cause analysis tools: 5-Why, fishbone (Ishikawa), fault tree, FMEA",
    "CAPA lifecycle: corrective action → preventive action → effectiveness review",
    "Customer complaint intake and tracking with response-time SLA",
    "Supplier quality scorecard: on-time delivery, defect rate, audit performance, recall history",
    "Internal audit + external audit + accreditation audit integration (links to Audit Management module)",
    "Tailored for Hyderabad workflow — pre-configured operator templates for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers",
    "Regulatory alignment with PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace — audit-ready evidence packages"
  ],
  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Hyderabad inspection contractor serving BHEL boilers/turbines and HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent) deploys quality management & ncr as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Hyderabad EPC quality team standardizes quality management & ncr across 4 simultaneous project sites in the India market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to ISRO satellite suppliers portals automatically.",
    "A growing Hyderabad-based service provider integrates quality management & ncr with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by BDL defense — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Hyderabad inspection company uses quality management & ncr to pass PESO and BARC nuclear audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Quality Management & NCR tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Hyderabad operator-portal requirements",
    "PESO audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from BHEL boilers/turbines updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the quality management & ncr module configured for Hyderabad operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BHEL boilers/turbines, HPCL Visakh refinery (adjacent), ISRO satellite suppliers, BDL defense, ECIL. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with PESO and other India regulators?",
      "Yes. PESO, BARC nuclear, DGCA aerospace, AERB radiation safety requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Hyderabad?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for India: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is the NCR → CAPA workflow structured?",
      "An NCR is opened on discovery (audit finding, customer complaint, internal observation, recurring issue). The workflow forces containment first (stop the bleeding), then investigation (root cause), then corrective action (fix this occurrence), then preventive action (stop it happening elsewhere). Effectiveness review 60–180 days later verifies the fix held. Each stage has a responsible owner, target date, and approval signature."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support AS9100D customer-specific quality clauses?",
      "Yes. AS9100D §4.4 requires that customer-specific quality clauses (e.g., Boeing D6-82479, Airbus PSPs, Pratt & Whitney ASQR-01) are flow-down to internal processes. The system maintains a customer-clause register with cross-reference to internal procedures, training records, and audit evidence."
