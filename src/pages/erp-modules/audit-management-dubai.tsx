  "desc": "Audit & Compliance Management ERP module for inspection companies in Dubai, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Distribution, ENOC and aligned with ADQCC, MOIAT. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company faces audits from three directions: internal (your own QMS), external (client and regulator), and accreditation (ISO 17025, AS9100, ISO 9001). Failing any audit can mean lost contracts, suspended accreditations, regulatory penalties, and damaged reputation.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Dubai, UAE, the audit & compliance management module is configured against local realities: Regional HQ city for GCC oil & gas. EPC contractors, inspection service multinationals. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Distribution, ENOC, DUBAL aluminum, DEWA power, and regulatory frameworks under ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Dubai inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Dubai inspection contractor serving ADNOC Distribution and ENOC deploys audit & compliance management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Dubai EPC quality team standardizes audit & compliance management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to DUBAL aluminum portals automatically.",
    "A growing Dubai-based service provider integrates audit & compliance management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by DEWA power — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",

      "Is the audit & compliance management module configured for Dubai operators?",

Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADQCC and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADQCC, MOIAT, Dubai Municipality, DCAS requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

      "What languages and currencies are supported for Dubai?",

      "Does it support multi-standard audits — ISO 9001 + ISO 17025 + ISO 45001 — in one walk-through?",
      "Yes. Integrated management system (IMS) audits are supported: a single audit can map findings to multiple standard clauses simultaneously. The checklist library lets you compose an audit from clauses across standards. Findings are tagged with all applicable clauses for proper containment and reporting."
    ],
    [
      "How is corrective action effectiveness verified after closure?",
      "Each corrective action has a follow-up review scheduled 60–180 days after closure (configurable per finding type). The reviewer assesses whether the same issue has recurred, samples performance data, and signs off effectiveness. Failed effectiveness reviews automatically reopen the finding for further root cause analysis."
