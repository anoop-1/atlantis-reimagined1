  "desc": "Corrosion Tracking & RBI ERP module for inspection companies in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG and aligned with ADNOC HSE, ADQCC. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to drive risk-based inspection (RBI) plans is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Abu Dhabi, UAE, the corrosion tracking & rbi module is configured against local realities: ADNOC controls 94% of UAE reserves. Ruwais industrial complex. Sour gas processing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, and regulatory frameworks under ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Abu Dhabi inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Risk-based inspection (RBI) per API 581: POF (damage factor) + COF (financial / safety / environmental)",
    "RBI risk-matrix dashboard (5x5 typical) with equipment ranking by risk score",
    "Inspection effectiveness scoring per API 581 Annex 2.C (highly effective / fairly effective / poorly effective)",
    "Tailored for Abu Dhabi workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene",
    "Regulatory alignment with ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA — audit-ready evidence packages"
  ],
  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Abu Dhabi inspection contractor serving ADNOC Onshore and ADNOC LNG deploys corrosion tracking & rbi as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Abu Dhabi EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking & rbi across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Borouge polyethylene portals automatically.",
    "A growing Abu Dhabi-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking & rbi with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Fertil ammonia/urea — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Abu Dhabi inspection company uses corrosion tracking & rbi to pass ADNOC HSE and ADQCC audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Corrosion Tracking & RBI tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Abu Dhabi operator-portal requirements",
    "ADNOC HSE audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from ADNOC Onshore updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea require manual reformatting per submission"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking & rbi module configured for Abu Dhabi operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, TAQA power & water. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADNOC HSE and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA, EAD environment requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Abu Dhabi?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UAE: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it implement the full API 581 RBI methodology?",
      "Yes. Both Part 2 (qualitative) and Part 3 (quantitative) workflows are supported. The damage-factor calculation engine implements all DMs in API 581 Annex 2 — thinning, SCC, HTHA, brittle fracture, external corrosion, mechanical fatigue, etc. The COF engine implements both financial-consequence (modified Part 5) and safety / environmental consequence models. Risk = POF × COF per Part 3 §5."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
