  "desc": "Certification & Personnel Qualification ERP module for inspection companies in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Pre-configured for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG and aligned with ADNOC HSE, ADQCC. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An NDT, welding, or inspection service company lives or dies by the currency of its technicians' certifications. A single expired ASNT Level II certificate on the wrong job can cost the contract, fail an audit, and damage the relationship with a major operator.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Abu Dhabi, UAE, the certification & personnel qualification module is configured against local realities: ADNOC controls 94% of UAE reserves. Ruwais industrial complex. Sour gas processing. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, and regulatory frameworks under ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Abu Dhabi inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Abu Dhabi inspection contractor serving ADNOC Onshore and ADNOC LNG deploys certification & personnel qualification as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Abu Dhabi EPC quality team standardizes certification & personnel qualification across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UAE market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Borouge polyethylene portals automatically.",
    "A growing Abu Dhabi-based service provider integrates certification & personnel qualification with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Fertil ammonia/urea — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Abu Dhabi inspection company uses certification & personnel qualification to pass ADNOC HSE and ADQCC audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the certification & personnel qualification module configured for Abu Dhabi operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ADNOC Onshore, ADNOC LNG, Borouge polyethylene, Fertil ammonia/urea, TAQA power & water. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with ADNOC HSE and other UAE regulators?",
      "Yes. ADNOC HSE, ADQCC, Federal NCEMA, EAD environment requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Abu Dhabi?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UAE: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Does it work with both SNT-TC-1A and ISO 9712 schemes simultaneously?",
      "Yes. Many inspection companies operate in markets requiring both — for example, a UAE company serving ADNOC (which accepts ASNT SNT-TC-1A) and operating in the EU (which requires ISO 9712). The system stores both qualification chains per technician with separate expiry, scope, and renewal workflows. Audit reports can be generated against either scheme or both."
    ],
    [
      "Can it match technician qualifications to job requirements automatically?",
      "Yes. When a project manager creates a job they specify required qualifications (e.g., 'UT Level II per SNT-TC-1A, valid BOSIET, ADNOC ACS-01 approved, English C1'). The system returns a ranked list of available technicians who match all criteria. Optional shadow-mode warns the project manager if any non-matching technicians are assigned."
