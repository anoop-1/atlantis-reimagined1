  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Bangkok, Thailand, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured against local realities: PTT Group corporate base. EEC corridor: Map Ta Phut, Rayong refining & petrochemicals. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from PTT Public Company, Thai Oil (TOP, Sriracha refinery), IRPC Rayong refining + petrochemicals, PTT Global Chemical (Map Ta Phut), and regulatory frameworks under DOEB Department of Energy Business, DIW Department of Industrial Works, TISI Thai Industrial Standards are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Bangkok inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Bangkok inspection contractor serving PTT Public Company and Thai Oil (TOP, Sriracha refinery) deploys inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Bangkok EPC quality team standardizes inspection scheduling & interval management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Thailand market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to IRPC Rayong refining + petrochemicals portals automatically.",
    "A growing Bangkok-based service provider integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by PTT Global Chemical (Map Ta Phut) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Bangkok inspection company uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass DOEB Department of Energy Business and DIW Department of Industrial Works audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inspection scheduling & interval management module configured for Bangkok operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for PTT Public Company, Thai Oil (TOP, Sriracha refinery), IRPC Rayong refining + petrochemicals, PTT Global Chemical (Map Ta Phut), Bangchak Corporation. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with DOEB Department of Energy Business and other Thailand regulators?",
      "Yes. DOEB Department of Energy Business, DIW Department of Industrial Works, TISI Thai Industrial Standards, OAP Office of Atoms for Peace requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Bangkok?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Thailand: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires an engineering justification — a corrosion-rate or remaining-life re-assessment by the inspector, or an operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with the full chain of approval, and the new due date the inspector sets is recorded with reminders. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 maximum extensions) are shown to the approvers to check."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer holding due dates, readings and records. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
