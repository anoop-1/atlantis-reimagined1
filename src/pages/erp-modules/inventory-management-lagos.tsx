  "desc": "Inventory Management ERP module for inspection companies in Lagos, Nigeria. Pre-configured for NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC and aligned with NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection equipment is expensive, mobile, and tightly regulated. A UT thickness gauge, an Olympus OmniScan, a radiography crawler, or a digital pressure calibrator can each cost $10,000–$80,000.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Lagos, Nigeria, the inventory management module is configured against local realities: Nigeria oil & gas hub. NNPCL refineries. Shell SPDC onshore. Deepwater offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, and regulatory frameworks under NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Lagos inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Lagos inspection contractor serving NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) and Shell SPDC deploys inventory management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Lagos EPC quality team standardizes inventory management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Nigeria market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Chevron Nigeria portals automatically.",
    "A growing Lagos-based service provider integrates inventory management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Lagos inspection company uses inventory management to pass NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and NMDPRA (downstream) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "cityPain": [
    "Inventory Management tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Lagos operator-portal requirements",
    "NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inventory management module configured for Lagos operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, ExxonMobil Nigeria. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and other Nigeria regulators?",
      "Yes. NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS, NIMASA requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Lagos?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Nigeria: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system track NDT probe usage and life cycles?",
      "Each probe gets a barcode/QR tag. When a technician scans a probe on check-out the system logs technician, project, asset under test, and start time. On check-in it logs end time + auto-increments scan hours. PAUT wedges and PA probes have manufacturer-recommended life (typically 1,000–3,000 hours); when a probe approaches its limit the system flags it for inspection and the supervisor receives a dashboard alert."
    ],
    [
      "Can it manage radioactive sources for industrial radiography?",
      "Yes — the radioactive source module is built for IAEA TS-R-1 and US NRC 10 CFR 71 compliance. It tracks Ir-192 / Se-75 / Co-60 source serial numbers, current activity (auto-decayed from last measurement), expiry, shipment documentation, daily survey records, and technician dose exposure. Source-handling permits and route plans are stored against the asset with audit-ready PDF export."
