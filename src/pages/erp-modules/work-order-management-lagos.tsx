  "intro": "An inspection company is a project-based business. Each job has a unique scope, a unique customer specification, a unique team, a unique timeline, and a unique compliance footprint.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Lagos, Nigeria, the work order & job management module is configured against local realities: Nigeria oil & gas hub. NNPCL refineries. Shell SPDC onshore. Deepwater offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, and regulatory frameworks under NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Lagos inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Lagos inspection contractor serving NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) and Shell SPDC deploys work order & job management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Lagos EPC quality team standardizes work order & job management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Nigeria market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Chevron Nigeria portals automatically.",
    "A growing Lagos-based service provider integrates work order & job management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Lagos inspection company uses work order & job management to pass NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and NMDPRA (downstream) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Work Order & Job Management tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Lagos operator-portal requirements",
    "NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the work order & job management module configured for Lagos operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for NNPCL refineries (Port Harcourt, Warri, Kaduna), Shell SPDC, Chevron Nigeria, TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria, ExxonMobil Nigeria. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory) and other Nigeria regulators?",
      "Yes. NUPRC (Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory), NMDPRA (downstream), NAPIMS, NIMASA requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Lagos?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Nigeria: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system handle scope creep and variation orders mid-job?",
      "When a technician encounters out-of-scope work in the field they create a variation request from the mobile app — describing scope, estimated hours, and rate. The project manager reviews and forwards to the customer; the customer e-signs in the portal; only then is the work logged as billable. This eliminates the after-the-fact 'we forgot to charge for this' loss."
    ],
    [
      "Can the field app work offline at remote / offshore worksites?",
      "Yes. Field data entry, photo capture, signature collection, and supervisor sign-off all work offline. The app caches up to 30 days of work-order data locally. When connectivity is restored data syncs automatically with conflict detection and resolution. Suitable for offshore platforms, desert sites, remote pipelines, marine vessels."
