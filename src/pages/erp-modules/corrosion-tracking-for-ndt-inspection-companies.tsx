  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to drive risk-based inspection (RBI) plans is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor ndt inspection companies, the corrosion tracking & rbi module is configured around the codes, regulators, and operator-specific requirements you face every day: ASNT SNT-TC-1A / CP-189 / ACCP, ISO 9712:2021, PCN GEN, CSWIP 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3, AWS QC1. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Saudi Aramco — SAEP-1142, ADNOC — ACS-01, QatarEnergy — NFPS, Shell — DEP so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Risk-based inspection (RBI) per API 581: POF (damage factor) + COF (financial / safety / environmental)",
    "RBI risk-matrix dashboard (5x5 typical) with equipment ranking by risk score",
    "Inspection effectiveness scoring per API 581 Annex 2.C (highly effective / fairly effective / poorly effective)",
    "Tailored for ndt inspection companies — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Saudi Aramco — SAEP-1142, ADNOC — ACS-01, QatarEnergy — NFPS vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person ndt inspection company runs corrosion tracking & rbi as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational ndt inspection companies deploys corrosion tracking & rbi across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "A growing ndt inspection company integrates corrosion tracking & rbi with their existing ERP (NetSuite, QuickBooks, or SAP) and CMMS — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "An audit-driven ndt inspection companies uses corrosion tracking & rbi to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Does corrosion tracking & rbi work specifically for ndt inspection companies?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for ndt inspection companies workflow with pre-built templates aligned to ASNT SNT-TC-1A / CP-189 / ACCP, ISO 9712:2021, PCN GEN, CSWIP 3.1 / 3.2 / 3.3. Operator-specific quality clauses for Saudi Aramco — SAEP-1142, ADNOC — ACS-01, QatarEnergy — NFPS are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
    ],
    [
      "How does the system integrate with our existing ndt inspection companies tools?",
      "Standard integration via REST API with major ndt inspection companies systems. Atlantis NDT ERP can run as the system of record for corrosion tracking & rbi while flowing relevant data to your accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite / SAP / Dynamics), CMMS (Maximo / SAP PM / Meridium / AspenTech APM), and customer-portal systems. Bi-directional sync keeps everything aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Can it scale from a small ndt inspection companies to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person ndt inspection company pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
    ],
    [
      "Does it implement the full API 581 RBI methodology?",
      "Yes. Both Part 2 (qualitative) and Part 3 (quantitative) workflows are supported. The damage-factor calculation engine implements all DMs in API 581 Annex 2 — thinning, SCC, HTHA, brittle fracture, external corrosion, mechanical fatigue, etc. The COF engine implements both financial-consequence (modified Part 5) and safety / environmental consequence models. Risk = POF × COF per Part 3 §5."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
