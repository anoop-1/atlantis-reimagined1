  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Jakarta, Indonesia, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: Pertamina HQ. Indonesian state energy. LNG Bontang/Tangguh. Petrochemical Tuban/Cilegon. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, and regulatory frameworks under SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Jakarta inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML corrosion rate calculation (short-term and long-term) per API methodology",
    "Wall-thickness projection with t-min, t-required, retirement-date forecasting",
    "Damage mechanism screening per API 571 with susceptibility scoring",
    "Tailored for Jakarta workflow — pre-configured operator templates for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG",
    "Regulatory alignment with SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board — audit-ready evidence packages"

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Jakarta inspection contractor serving Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) and Pupuk Indonesia deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Jakarta EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Indonesia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Bontang LNG portals automatically.",
    "A growing Jakarta-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Tangguh LNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Jakarta inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass SKK Migas and K3 Migas (HSE) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    "Corrosion Tracking tracked in spreadsheets — always 2 months behind Jakarta operator-portal requirements",
    "SKK Migas audit preparation takes 80+ hours per cycle — finds gaps too late to remediate",
    "Operator-portal flow-down from Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries) updates monthly — internal procedures lag by weeks",
    "Customer-format reports for Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG require manual reformatting per submission"

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for Jakarta operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Pertamina (Cilacap, Balikpapan, Dumai refineries), Pupuk Indonesia, Bontang LNG, Tangguh LNG, Krakatau Steel. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with SKK Migas and other Indonesia regulators?",
      "Yes. SKK Migas, K3 Migas (HSE), BKPM investment board, BPOM (drug/food regulator for QC labs) requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."

    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Jakarta?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Indonesia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "Yes. When UT thickness readings are entered against a TML the system recomputes short-term corrosion rate (most recent inspection vs. previous) and long-term corrosion rate (most recent vs. baseline). Both rates are stored and the larger absolute value is used for projection per API 570 §7.1.1 / API 653 §6.4. Outlier readings are auto-flagged for inspector review."
