  "desc": "Inspection Scheduling & Interval Management ERP module for inspection companies in Doha, Qatar. Pre-configured for QatarEnergy, RasGas and aligned with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Owner-operators and inspection contractors share one nightmare: discovering that an inspection due date has slipped past — and that nobody noticed. The consequences range from operational risk to regulatory finding to incident liability.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Doha, Qatar, the inspection scheduling & interval management module is configured against local realities: QatarEnergy LNG capital. North Field expansion. Cryogenic LNG infrastructure. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), and regulatory frameworks under QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Doha inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

    "API 510 pressure vessel intervals: external 5-yr, internal half-remaining-life capped at 10-yr, or per RBI",
    "API 570 piping intervals by class: Class 1 (5/10), Class 2 (10/20), Class 3 (10/20+), or per RBI",
    "API 653 tank intervals: external monthly visual + 5-yr formal, internal 10-yr or per RBI",
    "ASME B31.3 process piping inspection intervals with severe cyclic service adjustments",
    "Risk-based inspection (RBI) per API 581 — import RBI assessment, use computed inspection plan",
    "Inspection due forecast: 30 / 60 / 90 / 180 / 365 day windows with criticality ranking",
    "Tailored for Doha workflow — pre-configured operator templates for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG)",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Doha inspection contractor serving QatarEnergy and RasGas deploys inspection scheduling & interval management as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Doha EPC quality team standardizes inspection scheduling & interval management across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Qatar market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG) portals automatically.",
    "A growing Doha-based service provider integrates inspection scheduling & interval management with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Industries Qatar (IQ) — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Doha inspection company uses inspection scheduling & interval management to pass QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the inspection scheduling & interval management module configured for Doha operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for QatarEnergy, RasGas, Qatargas (now QatarEnergy LNG), Industries Qatar (IQ), QChem. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence) and other Qatar regulators?",
      "Yes. QCDD (Qatar Civil Defence), QGOSM (Qatar General Org Standards & Metrology), Ministry of Energy Affairs requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Doha?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Qatar: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How does the scheduler handle deferrals or extensions to inspection due dates?",
      "The deferral workflow requires engineering justification — corrosion-rate analysis, RBI re-assessment, or operating-conditions change — and a sign-off from a qualified inspector (API 510/570/653 certified) and the integrity manager. Deferrals are audit-logged with full chain of approval and the new due date is automatically set. Regulatory limits (e.g., NB-23 §3.3.1 maximum extension) are enforced."
    ],
    [
      "Does it integrate with our existing CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech)?",
      "Yes. Bi-directional integration with the major CMMS / EAM platforms. Inspection scheduling can be the master and push work orders into the CMMS, or the CMMS can be master and Atlantis ERP acts as the inspection-specific layer with code-aware scheduling logic. Asset hierarchies, equipment classes, and functional locations sync."
