  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register ERP module for inspection companies in Singapore, Singapore. Pre-configured for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom and aligned with MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. The asset register is the spine that connects equipment, inspection history, drawings, P&IDs, isometrics, corrosion mechanisms, RBI assessments, fitness-for-service calculations, and integrity operating windows.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Singapore, Singapore, the asset integrity & equipment register module is configured against local realities: Jurong Island petrochem hub. FPSO conversion (Keppel, Sembcorp). MOM CERT compliance. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, and regulatory frameworks under MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Singapore inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Hierarchical asset structure: site → unit → system → equipment → component → TML",
    "Equipment types: pressure vessel, piping circuit, storage tank, heat exchanger, fired heater, pump, compressor, exchanger tube bundle, valve, pipeline segment, structural member",
    "Damage mechanism library per API 571 (172 mechanisms): identification, screening, susceptibility scoring",
    "Integrity Operating Window (IOW) tracking with alarm levels (information / standard / critical)",
    "TML (thickness measurement location) database with sketch, photograph, GPS, and historical readings",
    "Corrosion rate computation (short / long term) per API 570 / API 653 methodology",
    "Tailored for Singapore workflow — pre-configured operator templates for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Singapore inspection contractor serving ExxonMobil Jurong refinery and Shell Bukom deploys asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Singapore EPC quality team standardizes asset integrity & equipment register across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Singapore market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to Vopak storage portals automatically.",
    "A growing Singapore-based service provider integrates asset integrity & equipment register with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Sembcorp Marine FPSO — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Singapore inspection company uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and NEA environment audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the asset integrity & equipment register module configured for Singapore operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for ExxonMobil Jurong refinery, Shell Bukom, Vopak storage, Sembcorp Marine FPSO, Keppel FPSO yards. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and other Singapore regulators?",
      "Yes. MOM (Ministry of Manpower), NEA environment, MPA marine, EDB Singapore requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Singapore?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Singapore: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada).

    ],
    [
      "Can it import asset hierarchies from existing CMMS / APM systems?",
      "Yes. Bulk-import templates accept asset, equipment, functional location, and tag hierarchies from Maximo, SAP PM, AspenTech APM, Bentley AssetWise, and Hexagon Meridium. Equipment numbering schemes, parent-child relationships, and equipment-class attribute sets are preserved. Ongoing sync via REST API keeps systems aligned."
    ],
    [
      "Does it cover API 571 damage mechanisms with screening?",
      "Yes. The damage mechanism module includes all 172 mechanisms from API 571 (3rd edition) with material, environment, temperature, and operating-condition screening criteria. The DM screening report identifies which mechanisms apply to each equipment item with severity ranking and recommended inspection methods."
