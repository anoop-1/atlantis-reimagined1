  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register for Industrial Coatings Inspection — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. NACE / AMPP CIP Level I / II / III, SSPC PA 2 (DFT measurement), SSPC SP 1 / SP 5 / SP 6 / SP 10 / SP 11 (surface prep). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Hempel (paint mfr), Jotun (paint mfr), AkzoNobel International (paint mfr), PPG (paint mfr) so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Tailored for industrial coatings inspection — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Hempel (paint mfr), Jotun (paint mfr), AkzoNobel International (paint mfr) vendor-portal flow-down requirements"
  ],
  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person industrial coatings inspection runs asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational industrial coatings inspection deploys asset integrity & equipment register across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "An audit-driven industrial coatings inspection uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

      "Does asset integrity & equipment register work specifically for industrial coatings inspection?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for industrial coatings inspection workflow with pre-built templates aligned to NACE / AMPP CIP Level I / II / III, SSPC PA 2 (DFT measurement), SSPC SP 1 / SP 5 / SP 6 / SP 10 / SP 11 (surface prep), ISO 12944 (corrosion protection). Operator-specific quality clauses for Hempel (paint mfr), Jotun (paint mfr), AkzoNobel International (paint mfr) are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."

    [
      "Can it scale from a small industrial coatings inspection to a global multinational?",
      "Yes. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS — a 5-person industrial coatings inspection pays a small monthly subscription with the same feature set as a 500-person global operation. Modules can be turned on individually or as a bundle; only pay for what you use."
