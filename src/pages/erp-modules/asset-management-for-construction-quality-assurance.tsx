  "desc": "Asset Integrity & Equipment Register for Construction Quality Assurance — purpose-configured module from Atlantis NDT ERP. AWS D1.1 / D1.5 (welding), ACI 318 / 301 (concrete), ASTM D698 / D1557 (soil compaction). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Inspection programs need an authoritative asset register. Pre-built workflows, report templates, and qualification matrices match the operator-specific quality clauses from Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering, WSP — engineering so your team is productive on day one — not after six months of configuration.",
  "industryFeatures": [
    "Tailored for construction quality assurance — pre-configured templates, terminology, and reports",
    "Integrates with Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering vendor-portal flow-down requirements"

  "industryUseCases": [
    "A 25-person construction quality assurance runs asset integrity & equipment register as a standalone module — replacing 3 spreadsheets and 2 disconnected SaaS tools — and reports a 60–80% reduction in administrative time within 90 days.",
    "A multinational construction quality assurance deploys asset integrity & equipment register across 12 sites under a global rollout. Region-specific data residency and language localization support GDPR, India DPDP Act, and Saudi NDMO requirements.",
    "An audit-driven construction quality assurance uses asset integrity & equipment register to pass ISO 9001 / ISO 17025 / AS9100 / customer-specific quality audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

      "Does asset integrity & equipment register work specifically for construction quality assurance?",
      "Yes. The module is configured for construction quality assurance workflow with pre-built templates aligned to AWS D1.1 / D1.5 (welding), ACI 318 / 301 (concrete), ASTM D698 / D1557 (soil compaction), ASTM C39 / C31 (concrete cylinder). Operator-specific quality clauses for Bechtel — EPC, Fluor — EPC, Jacobs — engineering are pre-loaded so the system is productive on day one without months of custom configuration."
