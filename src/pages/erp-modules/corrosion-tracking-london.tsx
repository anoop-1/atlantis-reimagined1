  "desc": "Pre-configured for BP HQ, Shell HQ and aligned with HSE, ONR (Office Nuclear Regulation). Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "Corrosion is the dominant degradation mechanism for ~85% of refinery and petrochemical equipment. Quantifying corrosion rates, projecting remaining life, screening damage mechanisms, and using all of this to set code-based inspection intervals is the heart of any modern integrity program.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in London, UK, the corrosion tracking module is configured against local realities: HQ city for IOCs. Diverse client base — UKCS, nuclear, aerospace, manufacturing. BINDT, TWI based. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from BP HQ, Shell HQ, TotalEnergies UK, EDF Energy nuclear, and regulatory frameworks under HSE, ONR (Office Nuclear Regulation), BINDT are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person London inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",
  "cityFeatures": [
    "Per-TML thickness history, with the short-term and long-term corrosion rates the inspector calculates stored alongside",
    "Wall-thickness trend per TML against the t-min and retirement thickness the inspector sets",
    "Damage mechanism records per API 571, as assigned by the integrity engineer",
    "Tailored for London workflow — pre-configured operator templates for BP HQ, Shell HQ, TotalEnergies UK",
    "Regulatory alignment with HSE, ONR (Office Nuclear Regulation), BINDT — audit-ready evidence packages"
  ],
  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size London inspection contractor serving BP HQ and Shell HQ deploys corrosion tracking as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A London EPC quality team standardizes corrosion tracking across 4 simultaneous project sites in the UK market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to TotalEnergies UK portals automatically.",
    "A growing London-based service provider integrates corrosion tracking with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by EDF Energy nuclear — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven London inspection company uses corrosion tracking to pass HSE and ONR (Office Nuclear Regulation) audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

    [
      "Is the corrosion tracking module configured for London operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for BP HQ, Shell HQ, TotalEnergies UK, EDF Energy nuclear, National Grid. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with HSE and other UK regulators?",
      "Yes. HSE, ONR (Office Nuclear Regulation), BINDT, EASA via UK CAA requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for London?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for UK: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "Can corrosion rates be computed automatically from UT thickness data?",
      "No. Atlantis ERP stores each UT thickness reading against its TML with the instrument, calibration record and technician, shows the thickness trend, and flags outlier readings for inspector review. The short-term and long-term corrosion rates under API 570 / API 653 are calculated by the inspector and can be recorded against the TML."
