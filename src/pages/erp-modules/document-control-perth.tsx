  "desc": "Document Control & QMS ERP module for inspection companies in Perth, Australia. Pre-configured for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) and aligned with WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore. Demo: info@atlantisndt.com.",
  "intro": "An inspection company's quality management system runs on documents: procedures, work instructions, calibration methods, inspection reports, certificates, training records, customer specifications. Lose control of those documents and the QMS audit fails.\n\nFor inspection teams operating in Perth, Australia, the document control & qms module is configured against local realities: Western Australia LNG and iron ore gateway. Pilbara FIFO support. Carnarvon Basin offshore. Pre-built templates support operator-specific quality clauses from Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, and regulatory frameworks under WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety are reflected in the workflow defaults. Atlantis NDT ERP is delivered as multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency — a 5-person Perth inspection contractor and a 200-person multinational both run on the same platform.",

  "cityUseCases": [
    "A mid-size Perth inspection contractor serving Woodside Energy and Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone) deploys document control & qms as a standalone module — replacing spreadsheets and disconnected SaaS — and reports 60-80% admin-time reduction within 90 days.",
    "A Perth EPC quality team standardizes document control & qms across 4 simultaneous project sites in the Australia market. Daily reports, audit packages, and customer-format reports flow to INPEX Ichthys portals automatically.",
    "A growing Perth-based service provider integrates document control & qms with accounting (QuickBooks / Xero / Tally for India / Sage / Reliance ERP) and the CMMS used by Santos GLNG — eliminating duplicate data entry and reducing customer-facing report turnaround from 5 days to <24 hours.",
    "A regulator-audit-driven Perth inspection company uses document control & qms to pass WorkSafe WA and NOPSEMA offshore audits with zero findings — evidence packages assembled in 30 seconds vs. 80+ hours of manual prep."

  "faqs": [
    [
      "Is the document control & qms module configured for Perth operators?",
      "Yes. Pre-loaded operator-specific quality clauses, qualification schemes, and report formats for Woodside Energy, Chevron Australia (Gorgon, Wheatstone), INPEX Ichthys, Santos GLNG, BHP iron ore. Atlantis NDT updates the operator-template library on a quarterly cadence so flow-down stays current with operator specification revisions."
    ],
    [
      "Does it comply with WorkSafe WA and other Australia regulators?",
      "Yes. WorkSafe WA, NOPSEMA offshore, DMIRS mines & safety, Australian Petroleum Safety Authority requirements drive the audit-readiness defaults. Annual + ad-hoc inspections generate audit-package PDFs with full chain-of-custody, personnel qualification matrix, calibration records, and procedure revision history pre-assembled."
    ],
    [
      "What languages and currencies are supported for Perth?",
      "Platform supports English (primary), and where relevant for Australia: Arabic (Gulf), Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi/Marathi/Telugu (India), Mandarin (China/SG), Spanish/Portuguese (Americas), French (West Africa/Canada). Invoicing supports USD, EUR, GBP, AED, SAR, INR, SGD, AUD, CAD, IDR, MYR, QAR, NGN — full multi-currency with VAT/GST as applicable."
    ],
    [
      "How is revision control handled — can people accidentally use an obsolete document?",
      "Each document has only one current revision visible by default. Obsolete revisions are retained in the audit history but marked clearly with an obsolete watermark. Users cannot download or print obsolete revisions without explicit override (logged). The system enforces 'current revision only' on all distribution and training workflows."
    ],
    [
      "Does it support 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures for FDA / EMA regulated industries?",
      "Yes. Optional 21 CFR Part 11 mode enforces user authentication for every electronic signature event, captures meaning-of-signature, prevents repudiation, and produces a tamper-evident audit trail with secure time-stamping. The validation package includes IQ / OQ / PQ documentation for FDA, EMA, and ANVISA inspection."
